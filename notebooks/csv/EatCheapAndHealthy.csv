"Vegan Chickpea Piccata!! Perfect for rice, pasta, or with roasted veggies!",309,zp44nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zp44nm/vegan_chickpea_piccata_perfect_for_rice_pasta_or/,10,1671386157.0,"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/oxKKmU8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oxKKmU8.jpg)

**Recipe here originally: [Vegan Lemon Piccata Sauce](https://exploringvegan.com/vegan-chickpea-piccata/)**

This chickpea piccata sauce is so good and so easy to make. You only need a few ingredients. I used plant-based butter made from beans, but you could use dairy butter or a mix of butter/extra virgin olive oil.

If you don't have capers, you could use finely chopped green olives instead, or even a couple of anchovy filets...it won't be exactly the same, but it will still give you that briny, salty flavor!

I served mine on top of pasta, but I think the chickpea sauce would be soooo good on top of thick slices of roasted cauliflower, and that's how I plan on serving it next time!

### Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
* 2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and finely minced
* 2 tablespoons capers, drained
* Pinch of crushed red pepper, optional
* 4 tablespoons plant-based butter
* ¾ cup water or vegetable stock
* ¼ cup lemon juice
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### For serving, optional:

* Cooked pasta, rice, or roasted veggies
* Freshly minced parsley

### Instructions

#### Roast the chickpeas:

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF. Arrange the chickpeas on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. Season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Transfer to the oven for 20–30 minutes, flipping the chickpeas once midway through cooking.

#### Prepare the sauce:

1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the capers to the onion and cook for 1–2 minutes until they just begin to crisp and turn golden brown. Season with crushed red pepper if you like.
2. Melt the butter into the onions and capers. Once melted and frothy add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until reduced by half. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the sauce:

1. Stir the lemon juice into the sauce and add the roasted chickpeas. Toss to coat and cook for 3–4 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings to your preferences.

#### To serve:

1. Serve the sauce with pasta, rice, or roasted vegetables. Garnish with freshly minced parsley if you like. Enjoy!",2022-12-18 19:55:57

By the price per pound, canned tuna is always cheaper than the pouch stuff, so I get that. But I recently realized the pouch stuff has like half as much water in it, they don't need to fill it with water like cans do for a proper seal, because they just vacuum seal the pouch. So even though I'm paying less per pound for the canned stuff, some of that weight is water that gets drained off, so it may not actually be cheaper per tuna.

It's not too expensive (about $4.15 USD by where I live), makes about six servings, and is vegan too. But you can un-vegan it. 

Ingredients: 

One pound dry chickpeas ($1.25)

One onion, minced diced or whatever you prefer ($0.85)

Three cloves garlic ($0.25)

Vegan butter or normal butter, ~~maybe half a cup or a whole cup~~ (edit: or however much you feel is right.) (Price varies a lot by the kind of butter. Maybe $0.50). Alternatively, oil of your choice is fine. I've used olive oil and it turned out okay.

Bullion of your choice (Price varies a lot by brand and amount)

Mixed veggies of your choice (Great Value stuff is usually about $1.00)

Maybe a cup of water (Pretty cheap, but not as cheap as air)

Instructions:

1. Soak chickpeas for several hours. I usually do like 24 hours, but if you use a pressure cooker then as few as 4 hours is usually adequate

2. Boil chickpeas until tender. Drain off excess liquid.

3. In a decent sized pot, saute onion until caramelized or your desired consistency 

4. Add garlic and saute for a few minutes

5. Add in some water and bullion. A few cubes or maybe a teaspoon of Better-than-Bullion. Stir until adequately mixed. 

6. Add chickpeas, mash them, and add enough water to get it to your desired consistency^1

7. Add mixed veggies^2. If you want a non-vegan version, add whatever meat you want. Shredded chicken might be good but the price will go up. 

8. To make it a little richer, add maybe a few tablespoons of olive oil if you have it

9. Salt to taste

Notes: I use an Instapot for the chickpeas. When I'm ready to cook them, I remove most of the water until the chickpeas are just barely covered and cook it for 60 minutes, not including heat up time and venting. Instead of adding water like in step 5 and 6, I just use the liquid from cooking the chickpeas and add the bullion after that. 

It's a pretty bland meal, but you could spice it up with whatever you have on hand. Hope it helps someone out. 

^1. I make it about like mashed potatoes 

^2. I usually use broccoli and cauliflower mix from Great Value.",2022-12-15 22:50:45

* 1.1lbs (500g) of ground beef (or 400g steak, cubed) 
* 9 small red potatoes 
* 1 whole egg
* Veggie Mix: Diced Onions, Garlic, Red Peppers/Jalapeños, tossed in olive oil 
* In and Out Sauce:  Avocado Mayo, White Vinegar, Ketchup, Jalapenos (relish or diced) 

**Steps:** 

* Cube Potatoes, and toss potatoes in olive oil, salt, and paprika. Bake in oven at 450F for 35 minutes. Halfway through, use a spoon to toss/move the potatoes around a bit to get crispy both sides 
* In a frying pan, toss the veggie mix and cook until fragrant and onions/garlic start to brown on the outside
* Add the cubed steak or ground beef, stir until cooked through, important: drain the fat from the pan, move meat + veggie mix to new bowl - while doing this, soft boil the egg. 
* In a small dish bowl, mix a large scoop of avacado mayo, 1 tbspoon of white vinegar, large scoop of ketchup, and 1 tbspoon of jalapeno relish, stir/whip until smooth and mixed. 
* At this point, you should have your meat+veggie in its own bowl, the ""in and out"" sauce in one bowl, the soft boiled egg, and remove the potatoes from the oven and keep on the baking tray.

Once everything is prepped, grab a fresh bowl, add potatoes at the bottom, then meat+veg, then crack the soft boiled egg on top, then add the In and Out sauce. 

For bonus points you can add things like: fresh cut avocado, fresh cut tomatoes, sauerkraut.

Yet another detailed chili recipe that can feed you for a week,240,zm3ubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zm3ubs/yet_another_detailed_chili_recipe_that_can_feed/,28,1671055897.0,"My wife and I love chili, so I make it about once a week in the fall/winter season. We've gotten into a routine where I'll make a huge batch on the weekend, and it will usually last us about 5 meals each. The great thing about this recipe is that it's really cheap and healthy.

The thing is, this is a bean chili. I know that bothers some, but I figure we eat enough meat throughout the week, and if you want to add meat to this you can. I wouldn't take away the beans though. Beans are extremely affordable and healthy. I don't write recipes so this may be rough, but I promise it's delicious and easy.

&#x200B;

Ingredients:

* 1 yellow onion, diced
   * Dice the onion how you like it in the chili. It really doesn't matter if you dice it small or larger chunks.
   * I like using one larger onion, or 2 smaller. I like a good amount of onion.
* 2-3 Jalapenos or other peppers, diced
   * Dice these normally. I remove the seeds but keep the flesh that holds the seeds for heat.
   * Go with whatever amount of pepper you want for the heat. That's going to be entirely up to your preference.
* Canned Beans 3-4 cans, not drained
   * I usually go with 1-2 cans dark kidney beans, 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto. Go with whatever you have available.
   * Feel free to use dried beans if you'd like. I'm going to assume you know how to prep them if you're using dried.
   * Not drained. The liquid in the beans is mostly water, but it has some thickening agents that helps thicken the chili, which is what you want.
* 2 14.5 oz Cans fire roasted diced tomatos
   * Get whatever brand you want.
* 1-2 cups Chicken Broth
   * I usually use Better than Bouillon if I don't have any on hand.
   * IMO, I wouldn't go out and buy chicken broth in a can or box. I always use BTB or make my own. You do you.
   * Start with 1 cup, if it needs more you'll know.
* 1 tbs of Tomato Paste
   * I usually just buy one of those sticks of tomato paste with the cap and squeeze a bit in there.
* Spices
   * This is (again) going to be largely up to your own preferences. This is what I typically do:
      * 1-2 tbs Granulated or Powdered Garlic, or fresh garlic if desired. (I'll likely still add some dried garlic too)
      * 1 tbs Onion Powder
      * 2 tbs smoked paprika
      * 1 tbs chili powder
      * Pepper to taste
   * FYI, I don't measure so these are huge approximations.

Instructions:

1. Heat up 1-2 tbs of oil in a big ole pot on medium to medium-high
2. Add in onion and cook for about 3-5 minutes, till just softened. Add in Jalapenos and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes. At this point, add in some fresh garlic if desired, and cook for 30 seconds.
3. If adding meat, add at this point and cook till browned.
4. Add in tomato paste and cook for 30-60 seconds.
5. Add in chicken broth and scrape bottom of pan. OR add in canned tomatoes and stir. Reduce heat while you are adding in all the remaining ingredients.
6. Add in everything else. Stir till fully mixed. Bring to boil. Reduce to a simmer and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until beans are soft and chili is reduced down to preferred consistency. It's okay if you go over 30 minutes if it needs to continue to reduce. Note: The hot chili will always be a little more runny than the chili that you serve in the bowl. It thickens as it cools.
7. Taste. Add salt if needed (likely will). Add more smoked paprika and/or chili powder if needed.
8. Serve with raw finely diced shallot,red onion, or green onion. For a less healthy version: Add sour cream, shredded cheese, and Fritos to the bowls.

&#x200B;

Total cost: 8-15 dollars depending on the price of the ingredients you use and if you are just now buying the spices. If you can't afford to buy the spices in bulk, I'd recommend getting a chili seasoning packet. Or a taco seasoning if you want, but it will be more of a Mex flavor. Which is how this should be anyways IMO. Chili is a Mexican dish.\\

Edit: Forgot to mention. Super important. Really the only thing that you can do wrong with this dish is burning the food on the bottom of the pan. It will affect the flavor of the final dish if you do this. I've done it, and it still turned out delicious. Just don't eat the burnt bits lol. Stir frequently to avoid this.

Edit 2: add cumin! Forgot this. 2 tbs",2022-12-15 00:11:37

I've used several egg substitutes before in baking to good effect.

I like the flavor of flax eggs the best. You need either flax seed flour/meal, which goes bad quickly unless you freeze it, or grind flax seeds as you need them. I like the nutty flavor that flaxseed adds, I like them on salads too. 1 Tbsp ground flaxseed + 2 ½ Tbsp water. Add with other ingredients

Chia seeds are easier, because you don't have to grind them. Just soak them and add. You do get the ittle chia seeds in your dough, they look like poppy seeds, but don't taste of anything. 1 Tbsp chia seeds + 2 ½ Tbsp warm water. Soak for 5 minutes then add.

Aquafaba is a fancy word for the juice in a can of chickpeas. Add 3 tablespoons for each egg. It can add a slight beany/legume taste to your baked goods however. Better for savory or highly flavored sweets. Not the best for plain sugar cookies

Would love to hear about your successes and failures with egg substitutes in baking.

I find that making it as-is is great, but you can also skip the oven part (or do it at a lower temp/less time) and it is still divine. This is from Ali Slagle's [I Dream Of Dinner](https://bookshop.org/p/books/i-dream-of-dinner-so-you-don-t-have-to-low-effort-high-reward-recipes-a-cookbook-ali-slagle/16979880?ean=9780593232514), which I **highly** recommend for easy, adaptable, nutritious, and delicious recipes. If you like Bittman/The Minimalist, I think you will enjoy this cookbook.

This recipe is for 1 me. It's not verbatim from the book, just how I've come to cook it (although it is pretty consistent with the original recipe). I think it might make two servings, but I eat the whole thing. Whoops!

**Ingredients**

* Olive oil
* 4 garlic cloves, peeled
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp. harissa (more to taste)
* 1 tsp. cumin
* 1 tbsp. capers (more to taste)
* 1 can chickpeas, not drained
* Feta or halloumi, sliced or cubed (about 4 oz. but add as much as you'd like)

**Preparation**

1. Heat oven to 450F\*
2. Add \~1.5T olive oil to oven-safe pan on medium heat
3. Add garlic (whole) to pan, let sizzle in the oil for a bit, then smash and stir. Repeat for a few minutes until golden brown and sticky
4. Add tomato paste, cumin, and harissa to pan. Stir it all together until a shade darker
5. Add chickpeas with their water to the pan, then add capers. Give it a stir, let it simmer for a bit, then adjust S&P
6. When oven is heated, add cheese to pan and drizzle with olive oil on top
7. Pop in the oven and bake until cheese is melty-ish, 10-20 minutes. If you want crispy bits, crank the broiler for a couple minutes
8. Eat on its own, with couscous, rice, bread, or any carb of your choice

\*The original recipe calls for baking it in the oven. It does thicken it up really nicely, but sometimes if I don't want to wait (usually because it smells so good and I am impatient), I will just reduce it a bit on the stove, then pop it in the oven at whatever temp it's at for a few minutes to let the cheese get a smidge melty.

Happy cooking

* *1/2 tsp. baking powder (makes it fluffy like a normal waffle)*
* *Salt to taste (HEFTY pinch of coarse salt for me, may vary based on type of salt used. No idea why the recipe didn't include salt in it originally, it's horribly under seasoned without the salt in the batter.)*

**Directions**

1. Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. 
2. **Simple/easy method** \- Blend oats, cottage cheese, eggs, egg whites, honey, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a blender until creamy. (This worked fine in my Vitamix, although have to annoyingly mix the ingredients a bit before they blend properly)
3. **Alternative method for step 2** 
   1. Blend the oats into a powder, remove oat powder
   2. Blend wet ingredients
   3. Incorporate dry ingredients and oats back into the mix and blend
4. Spray Pam/butter waffle iron (optional, but helps the waffle release a lot easier)
5. Ladle batter into preheated waffle iron according to manufacturer directions and cook the waffles until golden and crisp.

I received a box of steaks an a Christmas gift from my employer. Normally I'd just grill them up with typical grill sides (mixed vegetables, carrots, asparagus, mushrooms, etc).

To be honest im pretty bored of those sides. Does anyone have any suggestions for what i could make as a side?

Im open to cooking inside as well so if you have thoughts please share them. I'm not the best cook but I can follow a recipe. Im really just trying to give my wife a break from cooking and expand my repertoire so I appreciate the help.

Note: when i grill we typically have a mixed greens salad and various vegetables. We enjoy Brussels sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, onions, potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.

Thanks.

Edit: ty everyone for the amazing ideas. Ive gotten tons of recipes and ideas for my steaks. I appreciate everyones time and effort. Love this community!!!",2022-12-13 18:40:33

I'm exercising in the mornings now and really need to eat something in the AM. I can't bring myself to eat anything remotely sweet in the morning. I'm not sure why, but that idea of fruit or yogurt in the morning makes me gag. I was on a smoothie kick for a while, but I hated it. 

I also don't necessarily have time to make veggies and eggs every morning. I can do it some mornings, but not all the time. 

I'm not the biggest fan of those mini frittatas you make in a muffin pan and I wouldn't be consistent with prepping that anyway. I tried it for a bit and they're just too dense and dried out. 

This morning I ate a few pepperoni slices and some mozzarella cheese and it was exactly what I wanted. Slightly spicy, easy, savory. Perfect. I don't want to eat that every morning though, because that's a lot of processed meat and excess salt. Does anyone have any ideas for a healthier alternative? Perhaps something with veggies incorporated somehow? It clearly wouldn't need to be a traditional breakfast dish.

Pumpkin Lentil Curry -- a super easy pantry meal with canned pumpkin!!,592,zkift7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zkift7/pumpkin_lentil_curry_a_super_easy_pantry_meal/,36,1670895305.0,"**PIC:** [**https://i.imgur.com/suKJ39e.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/suKJ39e.jpg)

**Recipe here originally:** [**Pumpkin Lentil Curry with Chickpeas**](https://exploringvegan.com/pumpkin-lentil-curry-with-chickpeas/)

I've posted before about my love of canned pumpkin, and tonight I made a quick lentil curry with it and it reinforced my love. Canned pumpkin is super cheap, has a lot of fiber, and it's a great filler for soups, stews, etc. Adds a little bit of thickness, just a lil sweetness, and it's just SO good!! Tonight, I made a vegan lentil curry...only needed a few ingredients and it tasted amazing!

You can add any kind of veggie to this that you want if you're not a fan of mushrooms!! Try it with:

* Diced sweet or russet potato
* Cubed butternut squash
* Cauliflower or broccoli
* Carrots or zucchini

**Ingredients:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced
* 6 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced
* 1 tablespoon curry powder of choice (I used a tikka masala blend but you can use your favorite curry powder or garam masala)
* Cayenne powder or crushed red pepper, to taste
* 1 cup green or brown lentils, picked over and rinsed
* 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained
* 15-ounce can pumpkin purée
* 4 cups water or vegetable stock
* 1 teaspoon brown sugar, optional
* 4 ounces baby spinach
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cooked basmati rice, for serving

**Instructions:**

**Cook the vegetables:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook for 3–4 minutes until they begin to sweat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8–9 minutes until they brown and crisp up around the edges. Season with salt and pepper.

**Bloom the spice blend:**

1. Sprinkle the onion and mushrooms with the curry powder. Add cayenne or crushed red pepper to taste. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.

**Cook the lentils:**

1. Add the lentils to the pot and toss to coat. Add the chickpeas and toss to coat. Season again with salt and pepper.
2. Add the pumpkin pureée to the pot and stir to combine.

**Simmer the curry:**

1. Pour in the water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and brown sugar if using. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 25–30 minutes or until the lentils are completely tender and the curry has thickened. Stir in the spinach and simmer for 5 minutes until wilted. Taste and season.

**To serve:**

1. Serve the lentil curry with cooked basmati rice and with fresh herbs or greens, like cilantro or scallions. Enjoy!",2022-12-13 03:35:05

this is where frozen brussel sprouts in air fryer come in;When you notice that you are consuming healthy vegetables.

### Ingredients

Servings

* 1 pound Brussels sprouts
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1⁄4 teaspoon black pepper
* 3 cloves cloves garlic thinly sliced (optional but delish!)

#### Optional Toppings

* 1 tablespoon balsamic glaze or reduced balsamic vinegar
* Drizzle pomegranate molasses
* 2 teaspoons pure maple syrup
* 3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese

### Instructions:

1. Trim off the ends of the Brussel sprouts and remove any brown outer leaves. Cut them in half from stem to end. If any are very large, cut them into quarters from stem to end so that all the pieces are fairly similar in size and cook evenly.
2. OPTIONAL—This step makes sure the Brussels sprouts a little more tender in the middle; that said, if you don't mind a firmer sprout, you can skip it—I like my Brussels sprouts firm/tender inside and crispy outside, so I typically skip it—Place the Brussels sprouts in a large bowl and cover with warm tap water. Let sit 10 minutes.
3. Preheat the air fryer to 375 degrees, according to the manufacturer's instructions (for my air fryer, that's 3 minutes of preheating).
4. Drain the Brussels sprouts and with a towel, lightly pat dry. Wipe out the bowl you used for soaking, then add the Brussels sprouts back to it (if you didn't soak the sprouts, simply place them in a large mixing bowl). Drizzle with the oil and sprinkle with the salt and black pepper. Toss to coat evenly, then add them to your fryer basket.
5. Cook the sprouts for 5 minutes, then slide out the basket and shake it to toss the Brussels sprouts to promote even cooking. Cook 5 additional minutes, then slide out the basket again. The Brussels sprouts should look like they are getting nice and crispy and are almost done (if not, let them cook a minute or so longer). Add the garlic cloves and toss to coat once more. Cook 2 to 4 additional minutes, checking and shaking the basket often, until the Brussels sprouts are deeply crisp.
6. If adding toppings, transfer the Brussels sprouts to a serving bowl (or wipe out the mixing bowl you previously used) and stir in any desired toppings. Enjoy hot.",2022-12-12 12:36:46

Im still new to living on my own and managing my own budget and I’m kinda struggling. Full time student and part time job; my grocery budget comes from food stamps(US) and I have a budget for $200 a month for 2 people. Since the holidays coming around I noticed meats prices are rising from $6lb up $12/lbs for meats like beef and pork. Best deals I found are now buying the leftover thanksgiving turkeys for $2/lbs and meal planning ahead. 

I’m curious how other people budget for fresh meats and produce? I don’t have a lot of flexibility in my budget because rent is really high where I live too and uses almost my whole check. I really want to get more protein and fruits and veggies in my diet but it’s hard right now and I wonder if I should just eat more protein powder and canned tuna Till they go down again. Not ideal I know but I don’t have parents to ask lol so I turn to Reddit. 

Do you have tips like using a percent of the budget just for those items or is the price you won’t go over $/lbs? I’m still learning what’s a good deal in general for fresher foods

Edit: thanks for all the tips y’all, I wasn’t expecting a lot but y’all really helped me get new ideas to try and look further around me for farmers markets and smaller shops. 

Sorry if I offended a few people including my food stamp benefits. I suppose I should have added I’m in LA and $200 is for my house of 2. I lived in a village of town just a few months ago so this tied with inflation is a major culture shock for me",2022-12-09 00:29:58

Chickpeas and Rice! My new favorite one-pot meal!,1216,zg2k9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zg2k9f/chickpeas_and_rice_my_new_favorite_onepot_meal/,62,1670514285.0,"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/UD89BEt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UD89BEt.jpg)

**Recipe here originally:** [**One-Pot Chickpeas and Rice**](https://exploringvegan.com/one-pot-chickpeas-and-rice/)

I made a version of this the other night with chicken thighs, and we liked it so much I decided to revisit it as a vegan recipe! It's sort of like risotto, but I let it simmer covered for 25-ish minutes, then I stir in butter and a little cheese (use plant-based or dairy, depending on your dietary needs) and continue stirring until it's thickened and creamy.

It's really, really easy to make and so delicious!

*If you want to make this with chicken, you can just fry bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs first and then cook all the veggies and aromatics and rice and then add water according to the recipe above, place chicken on top, and then cover and simmer. Remove the chicken from the pot, continue stirring/adding butter/cheese, and then place the chicken back on top and broil for a couple of minutes to crisp up the skin.*

## Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 6 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* ½ cup roasted red bell peppers, diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or use ½ teaspoon dry
* ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste
* 1 cup arborio, carnaroli, or any short-grain white rice
* ¼ cup water and juice from 1 lemon (or use white wine)
* 3 cups water or vegetable stock
* 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 3 tablespoons plant-based butter
* ½ cup freshly grated plant-based parmesan (or use a handful of your favorite grated cheese)
* Salt and pepper

## Instructions

## Sauté the aromatics:

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally stirring, for 8-9 minutes until golden brown. Adjust heat as needed.
* Add the roasted red peppers, garlic, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 minute.

## Cook the rice:

* Add the rice to the pot and toss to coat. Season with salt. Cook for 1 minute until it begins to toast lightly.
* Pour in the water and lemon juice (or wine) and bring it to a boil. Cook for 1–2 minutes.

## Simmer the rice:

* Add water or vegetable stock and chickpeas and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20–25 minutes.
* Turn the heat to medium and partially remove the lid (the pot should be half-covered). Rapid simmer for 5 minutes.

## Finish the rice:

* Turn the heat on the rice to medium-low and stir regularly. Continue simmering and stirring to cook off any excess liquid if needed. Stir in the plant-based butter and parmesan and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring regularly, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Consistency should be creamy, not soupy! Add salt if needed.

## To serve:

* Sprinkle a few basil leaves on top of the pot and serve immediately. Enjoy!

Chicken quarters were on sale at my local grocery store so I used them for meal prep, here's the recipe for four servings:

Ingredients:

1. 4 lbs chicken quarters (chopped into thighs/drumsticks) - $6.90 for a 10 lb bag
2. 2 lbs red potatoes - $5 for a 5 lb bag
3. 2 lbs broccoli - $1.80 per lb
4. Seasoning of your choice - variable/optional
5. Salt - variable/optional
6. Olive oil - variable

Steps:

1. Preheat oven to 425 F.
2. \*Optional\* - chop the chicken to separate the drumstick from the thigh at the joint.  Trim excess skin/fat.
3. Season both sides of the chicken liberally on a baking pan.  Don't forget to peel the skin back to season the meat underneath!
4. Chop potatoes into quarters or smaller if the potatoes are large enough.
5. Place potatoes in a mixing bowl, drizzle with olive oil, salt, and toss around.  Empty bowl of potatoes on baking sheet.
6. Place the chicken and the potatoes into the oven when it is preheated to 425, set a timer for 20 minutes.
7. Chop broccoli off the largest parts of the stem if you don't like it.
8. Place  broccoli in a mixing bowl, drizzle with olive oil, salt, and toss  around.  Empty bowl of broccoli on baking sheet, try to make the crowns  face upright to allow for crisping.
9. When  your timer goes off 20 minutes after placing the chicken/potatoes in  the oven, place the broccoli in the oven with the chicken and potatoes.   Set a timer for 15 more minutes.
10. After  your 15 minute timer goes off, pull the chicken from the oven and check  the temperature with a thermometer in the thickest part of the largest  piece, it should be 165 F or very close.  If not 165, place back in oven  for more cooking.  Pull the potatoes and broccoli from the oven and  touch check them for preferred doneness.
11. \*Optional\*  - if you prefer the skin on your chicken crispy, turn the oven on low  broil and place the chicken back in the oven on the top rack.  Visually  check every couple minutes to make sure the skin doesn't burn and remove  when ready.

This meal reheats well and is healthy enough for my taste, I hope you enjoy it as well.

egg wrap!

**ingredients**

* 3 medium eggs
* 1 roma tomato, chopped
* 2 tbsp of pickled jalapenos, chopped
* 1/4 c shredded Mexican-blend cheese
* 1 tsp butter
* one 10"" flour tortilla
* three 6"" pieces of bacon (pork bacon)

**directions**

1. Cook the bacon over low heat in a cold skillet.
2. While that cooks, whisk your eggs and add the chopped tomato and jalapeno. I also added salt and pepper here.
3. Drain bacon on a paper towel, dispose of bacon grease, add 1 tsp of butter to pan, and add egg mixture.
4. Scramble for 2-3 minutes until done. Turn off the heat and add a pinch of the cheese.
5. Warm the tortilla up -- either over a gas stovetop or in the microwave with a damp paper towel
6. Add the rest of the cheese to the tortilla, top with the warm eggs, and add bacon.
7. Wrap or fold in half, and add a little bit of ketchup, hot sauce, salsa, or whatever else you like.",2022-12-06 16:32:07

•4 cups Spinach
•Pepper
•Olive oil (just a little for the pan so the spinach doesn’t stick)


•Sauté spinach in a pan on medium heat (only until wilted and then remove from heat). Don’t over cook. No need to drain anything. There really shouldn’t be much liquid if any. Cook it only until it wilts/softens (maybe a minute or two, with or without a lid on). 
•Open Boursin cheese and place into mixing bowl. Add sautéed spinach to same bowl, and mix together till blended. 
•Slice a pocket into the side of each chicken breast. 
•Divide spinach cheese mixture into 4 portions, and stuff each portion into each chicken breast. (It’s okay if you overfill them. It will stay inside the chicken pretty well but some will melt into the pan making extra delicious sauce for your sides! I like to have extra sauce for my rice, but if you find it’s too much, you could just use one box of Boursin cheese the next time).

If you're picking up a ham or two, here are a few tips:
* the most commonly found options are ""with natural juices,"" ""water added,"" and ""ham and water product."" You want one with natural juices, both of the others have noticeably more water.
* Shank and Butt are basically the two ends of the leg, the butt end has more meat and less bone and typically has a more rounded shape. The shank end has a more identifiable bone shape at the back of it and is sometimes cheaper.
* Spiral hams can save you a lot of headaches slicing them particularly if you're doing sandwiches, and even past the end of the spiral there's a lot of meat suitable for dicing or thicker ham steaks.
* *Spiral hams are often an exception to the shank/butt price difference*, so look for butt end spiral hams to get more for your money.
* Save that ham bone for use in making a big pot of split pea soup! Cooking it in with the peas will make lots of bits of meat you couldn't get easy to separate off, and you can also dice up some of the odd-size chunks to add more meat if you want.

Frugal and healthy fresh winter vegetables - cabbage🥬 and carrots🥕,67,zc268z,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/zc268z/frugal_and_healthy_fresh_winter_vegetables/,33,1670133877.0,"These two are very inexpensive, widely available, and also last in the refrigerator for a few weeks. I mean head cabbage, not leaf cabbage or kale. Long life means less waste!

With cabbage, use a bit off a head, then keep in a plastic bag. If the cut surface turns brown, cut the surface layer off (save to use in vegetable stock) and the rest is fine. A large hole grater makes carrots easy to eat and quick to cook, and much easier than trying to slice or dice carrots.

Add shredded cabbage leaves and grated carrots and cabbage cores to lots of things. Throw in with rice in a rice cooker. Add to pasta toward the end of cooking and then drain with the pasta. Both are great additions to stir fries, soups, and ramen.

Grated carrots can even go in sweet dishes like oatmeal and of course carrot cake.

Use raw (or lightly pickled) shredded cabbage anyplace you would use lettuce, like on a burger or in tacos.

Raw, there are a lot of good recipes for cabbage and carrot slaw, with lots of different variations. They will last and even improve in the refrigerator for a few days, giving a fresh vegetable taste when most fresh vegetables are expensive.

Would love to hear other ways y'all use these two inexpensive winter standouts.

\-Assorted bell peppers.  You can usually buy a pack of 3 different colors, probably cheaper to buy in bulk but I like the simplicity of the 3-pack and the colors.  If they're small I buy a couple of extra on the side.

\-1 large onion.

\-1 tomato.

\-Whole-wheat tortillas.

\-Tortilla seasoning packet.  (Old El Paso, etc.). These things are bomb and usually really cheap, IMO worth it, but you can also just use spices you have at home (chili powder, cumin, cayenne, black pepper, even a little sugar, etc.)

\-Your favorite hot sauce.

&#x200B;

**Steps**

1. Rinse and chop veggies.  I like a more fine chop than traditional strips since the beans are small and round (not like chicken strips).
2. Sauté veggies in some oil until soft.  A little browning is nice.  I add a pinch of salt to the veggies. (Note: You need a large pan or wok.  I use a paella pan.)
3. While veggies are being sautéd drain and rinse your beans (or prepare them beforehand).
4. Add beans to the pan.  Sauté a couple of minutes.
5. Add seasoning mix or spices.  I add an extra pinch of salt for good measure even though most seasoning packets already have it.  Stir it well while you sauté for a couple more minutes.
6. Serve over tortillas with some hot sauce if you're into that.

Cheap, healthy, easy, and delicious!  Just be careful with the gas! 😎

Frozen meal prep q: has anyone prepared sauces with soy milk? How well does it thaw and heat up?,5,za95ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/za95ox/frozen_meal_prep_q_has_anyone_prepared_sauces/,6,1669949772.0,"As a broke college student starting finals, I need some help with a somewhat healthy meal prep 🥹

I took advantage of some discounts and bought soy milk over a month ago (“natural” neutral flavour, low fat, tetrapack packaging so it won’t go bad soon). I still have four unused containers of soy milk in my pantry, and one open in my fridge. The thing is, it does go bad rather quickly once opened. (📌)

I’m thinking of ways of using the whole container as soon as possible, not only in cereal and coffee, but to incorporate it into savoury dishes; for example, I want to make a chile poblano green sauce (like the one used for some green pastas, instead of broccoli and spinach), with soy milk instead of dairy cream (I’m avoiding lactose), reducing it and freezing it for later.

My question is, if I prepare my pasta sauce with soy milk and freeze it for later meal prep, then thaw it and heat it up to put it on pasta… would there be an issue? Like, would the taste or texture be “problematic” to fix after thawing? (As in, can I just mix the sauce again or would it chunk somehow? I’ve never frozen soy milk before but I read the ingredients separate 😵‍💫)

Any other savoury, frozen-meal-prep ideas with soy milk are greatly appreciated! Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language.

Take care everyone!

(📌) I’ll still drink it straight here and there, but I’m worried of leaving it for too long in the fridge once opened. It starts getting too “smelly”. I can’t explain it, it hasn’t gone bad yet, but the nutty soy smell intensifies and I’m worried of getting sick… I’ve noticed I’m not drinking it as much for this same reason. That’s why I’m worried of using it soon. I’m also considering switching to oat milk, but with this economy, I might just make my own! 😂",2022-12-02 04:56:12

Good luck to everyone on a budget like us, hope this gives some inspiration. This is what we ate last week, I was happy with what we did for $95. Most things purchased at Aldi and a couple things at the local farmer's market. Almost everything was prepped in a couple hours on a Sunday after going shopping. We have one big eater who is a meat eater and one smaller eater who is a vegetarian, but this would work with two medium eaters who are willing to incorporate meatless meals. You could switch the tofu out for ground chicken, beef, or turkey for just a couple extra dollars, or even do sausage since that's pretty cheap but typically higher in sodium.

Would be more nutritious with brown rice but white tastes so good here haha. Made 5 meals.

**Dinner 1: Grilled chicken fajitas with peppers and onion.** 2.5 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs marinated in olive oil lemon juice and seasonings, cooked on the grill. Could also easily do on sheet pan in oven. 1.5 green bell peppers and 1 onion, sliced, cooked on the stovetop. Served over 3 sets of doubled corn tortillas. Made 5 meals. About 700 cal per meal including oil, 51g protein, 13 grams of fiber, mostly unsaturated fat. Keep sodium low by using No-Salt.

**Lunch/Dinner 2: Beef chili.** 1lb ground beef made into chili with spices, tomato sauce, tomato paste, 1.5 green pepper, 1 onion, black and kidney beans.

Allergies are a pain for me when it comes to planning healthy meals, and I’m totally open to any suggestions or resources you beautiful people could pass along. I will be completely honest and admit that I do not understand some of my allergies. 

In order of severity, I am allergic to: 

Nuts (yep, all of them. full blown anaphylactic shock)
Shellfish
Fish
Coconut 
Soybeans (and food like tofu that are predominantly made of soybean. I can safely consume soy sauce though??????)
Raw fruit*
Raw vegetables*
Healthy oatmeal (I can eat the super sugary processed stuff like what Quaker Oats sells in those tiny brown packets, but steel cut or otherwise is a no go)

*If fruits and veggies are cooked to being a bit mushy, then I’m fine. If even slightly less cooked, my lips and tongue swell and itch like there’s no tomorrow. This is where I start wondering what’s wrong with my body. Kinda rules out salads unfortunately.

I am not allergic to gluten, dairy, eggs, meat other than fish, and peanut oil (this is where I’m really lost). I’ve tried all these items multiple times and I can confidently say these lists are frighteningly accurate. Ended up in the hospital a few of those times lol.

Is It Safe to Make Overnight Oats Without a Fridge if Soaking With Water Only?,10,z955ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z955ni/is_it_safe_to_make_overnight_oats_without_a/,25,1669846529.0,"I find that the oats don't get properly soaked soft when I do it in the fridge and it causes me digestive issues. I tried soaking it once without the fridge at room temp and it was much much softer when I ate it. I just don't know if it's completely safe and I only did it once so that's not enough to determine if it will be spoil-free every time. If it is safe, I will definitely be soaking without the fridge from now on because it's so much softer and easier to eat/digest.

I should also mention that I microwave till it boils after soaking so any pathogens should theoretically be dead, but heat doesn't decompose spoilage toxins to nontoxic constituents if present. 

[This](https://mylongevitykitchen.com/the-truth-about-overnight-oats/) blog post even recommended soaking with room temp-warm water, but I don't have a convincing reason to trust them as they didn't provide any evidence that it's safe.

Eating “charcuterie style” instead of full meals?,1783,z8yucj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z8yucj/eating_charcuterie_style_instead_of_full_meals/,393,1669832662.0,"Bit of background:
I’ve been a cook for most of my life, but I hate cooking for myself. I’m a 33 year old male, 5’11 and around 155lbs. I’m single, and I live alone. 

I keep myself fairly busy, and I hate just sitting and eating meals. Nothing ever sounds appetizing, especially by the time I’m done cooking it. 

I was thinking of just buying myself cheese, veggies, fruits, and meats from the deli and eating it charcuterie style, as opposed to making full meals multiple times a day. I can’t seem to find any info on this, and anytime I google anything with “diet” (or eating styles in general) it’s all about losing weight; which is something I do not need to worry about. 

The idea of being able to just slice up an apple, throwing some peanut butter, cheese, and maybe salami (or something of that sort), blanch veggies, etc. is far more appealing to me. 

It’s a little pricier to do it this way, but the amount of time I save, I think, would make up for it. There is also the peace of mind knowing I always have food to eat, but don’t have to stress the time figuring out what sounds good to throw together. 

Any thoughts?

Thanksgiving Turkey Bone Broth + bonus stew!,3055,z8d7f4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/z8d7f4,123,1669772393.0,"awwww yissss - it's soup and stew season.
I've been making bone broth for a few years, and it's been getting easier and easier. more of my kitchen mindset goes into planning and making broth. and it's practically free! I save all bones, and my onion carrot and celery ends in bags in the freezer and use them as I make more broth.  jars get filled, cooled, and stored in the freezer (we have a small chest freezer for all of this).  

I was thinking about this broth long before we even cooked the turkey.

after Thanksgiving dinner I stripped all the meat, and broke apart the carcass. all the bones and organs fit into a freezer bag, and into the freezer it went.
yesterday to start the broth, I added the bag of bits to a stock pot and covered everything with water with a tablespoon or two of ACV, and let it sit for about 30 min. turned the burner on and brought it to a boil. skimmed a little bit of goo from the top, then added a bit of aromatics (mostly onion, with celery and carrots). cooked at a barely simmer for 24 hours.

made turkey stew tonight with some of it as soon as it was done. I had saved a jar of the rest of the turkey drippings too...good God what an addition. used the fat off the top to sautee onions, then added the thick AF gelatin goodness to the stew. sounds grossly indulgent but all the collagen, gelatin, vitamins, minerals, and anti oxidants are so insanely good for your joints, gut, immune system!",2022-11-30 03:39:53

1) Mash. Heat milk in a pan, add salt, pepper, gravy granules, garlic purée. Add mashed potato flakes and mix. Add butter. Steam frozen veg in the microwave and mix in.

2) Rice. Boil rice, add garlic, lemon, herbs. Add steamed frozen veg.

3) Mac and cheese. Boil pasta, drain, add butter, nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, chili flakes. Add milk and bring to simmer, remove from heat and add cheese sauce granules. Add steamed frozen veg.

These meals are achievable as they are relatively low effort and low cost. I tend to buy a big bag of pasta, rice and a few bags of mash flakes and milk, and the big bags of frozen veg, and the rest is just herbs/spices or garlic paste. My budget is really low.

My weekly chicken soup! This time with chickpeas and macaroni,61,z71p9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z71p9v/my_weekly_chicken_soup_this_time_with_chickpeas/,1,1669654692.0,"PIC: [https://imgur.com/a/h4OZRZV](https://imgur.com/a/h4OZRZV)

On Sundays, I often boil up a whole chicken to make a big batch of chicken soup. I've been trying to use some odds and ends in my pantry and ended up throwing in some chickpeas and an opened box of elbows. it was really good and doesn't require a ton of ingredients, plus you can basically swap out just about anything or add anything to the soup.

For the broth, use any combo of scrap veggies you have. I leave the paper on the onions and garlic. You can also throw in herbs like thyme or parsley.

**Chicken broth:**

* 3-pound whole chicken, giblets reserved for another use
* 3 carrots, cut into thirds
* 3 ribs celery, cut into thirds
* 1 large yellow onion, quartered
* 1 head garlic, halved crosswise
* Salt 
* Water

**Soup:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 carrots, peeled and sliced into thick rounds
* 3 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 1 tablespoon paprika (you can supplement this with a little smoked paprika for smoky undertones)
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* 2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained
* 1/2 cup elbow macaroni
* 5 ounces baby spinach or Lacinato kale
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Make the broth:**

1. Place chicken in a large stockpot and cover with water by about 1–2 inches. Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and season liberally with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 1–2 hours. Skim off any foam or scum from the top as it cooks.
2. Using tongs, remove the chicken from the pot and transfer it to a bowl. 
3. Return the stock to a low boil (rapid simmer) for 20 minutes to reduce it further. It will deepen in color.

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin. Pick the meat from the bones and shred or cut the meat into bite-sized pieces. Reserve carcass for another use. Set the meat aside.

**Strain the broth:**

1. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard the solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.

**Cook the soup:**

1. Heat the neutral oil in the pot. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 5–7 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, paprika, and crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Return the chicken to the pot and add the chickpeas.
3. Pour in the prepared broth. You should have enough to cover the ingredients in the pot fully. Supplement it with water if needed. Taste and season once more.
4. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes or until the carrots are almost fork-tender.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Bring the soup back to a boil. Add the elbow macaroni to the soup *(note: you can cook it separately if you don't like pasta swelling)*. Cook for 8–10 minutes until pasta is al dente.
2. Reduce heat to low and stir in spinach. Let simmer for 3–4 minutes. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle soup into bowls and enjoy!",2022-11-28 18:58:12

Pastry (as in puff pastry, filo etc) - some in particular are a lot of work. Better just to buy I think. And you still have to add ingredients and cook to turn it into a dish. 

Pizza (_as in 'low-cal' bases made of cauliflower etc_) - perhaps just me. Tried so many ways to make it cheaper and lower calorie but either ends up being gross or similar cost/calories as regular. I think I have to treat pizza as my occasional store-bought treat. 

Bread (_I do make bread_) - I think it's pretty easy to make bread, especially no-knead, so I'm continuing to make my own. 

... a lot of 'bready' stuff huh. What are some other things you find better to just buy premade?

Thanks :)

EDIT 1: I'm gonna make pizza again but without mad ingredients like cauliflower or blended up chicken breast. Homemade (traditional) pizza goooood!

EDIT 2: Holy butterbeans! This got bigger than I expected (""That's what she said""). Lots of good tips so far. I'll have a good read of everything. Thank you everyone 🙂👍🏻

Diet Help - Living With Disability,30,z6q458,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z6q458/diet_help_living_with_disability/,28,1669620559.0,"Hello everyone as the title says after several knee injuries and surgeries I am living with permanent limited mobility. I am 33 and get around with a cane and can even walk an okay bit on certain days, but others can be more restrictive.

As a result of complications I have a few needs in my diet that have changed. I was curious if anyone here had similar experiences with needing certain nutritious, low calorie and low carb meals on a budget of having to pay off American medical bills. If you are from the US then I am sure you get it, if you are not then I am sure you have seen stories about it and it's every bit as bad as it is portrayed.

I'll make a quick list for the sake of making the need straightforward to understand and if anybody has any recommendations I am incredibly appreciative. I have a budget of $200 a week give or take. I can go higher if you think it necessary as I already do but it would be nice to get it lower so I can afford more treatment. 

- High calcium
- High vitamin D
- Fiber
- High protein 
- High amino acids
- Low vitamin K (blood thinner interaction)
- Potassium
- Magnesium 
- Under 2500 calories or lower (hard to exercise)
- heart healthy if possible? (I don't know counts)
- is lowering blood clot risk by diet a thing? (have DVTs)

This obviously does not have to be one meal that has all of this, if there is one that's amazing, looking for a way to get this every week. If it saves money happy to eat quite a bit of the same thing over and over. Lowering what I spend is the name of the game to get some more physical therapy.

Literally any help here is so greatly appreciated by anyone kind enough to take the time to look through this. I've done some research on my own but I am by no means an expert. I am an omnivore, I've always been a fairly good cook and before my injuries a few years ago always ate as healthy as I could anyway. The difference now is the restrictions and the needs on a budget and that I need to drastically cut calories as I was formerly very active but now I cannot be.

Still trying to find ways to get my heart rate up. If any of you need to know directly more about my condition I have extremely early onset osteoporosis, some joint deterioration and I've had complications from my surgery resulting in blood clots, gout and lymphedema.

You are all awesome thank you so much for any help! Hope you are all having a fantastic day.

Edit 1: I'm happy to go shopping and provide and update if you are all kind enough to provide advice as well. May be useful as a regional price comparison.

Edit 2: Vitamin K not E. Sorry brain fog. Also this requirement is actually minor compared to some other medications on the market so it does not have to be absent.",2022-11-28 09:29:19

My husband and I have been trying to keep our budget at $600/ month for groceries (this would include things like soap and trash bags). We have failed every time. I am the one primarily in charge of getting the groceries. We have a toddler and a baby. Wal mart is usually cheapest but they have been really hit or miss with their inventory and curbside pick up. We also have Publix and Harris teeter. I have a harris teeter acct so I can do pickup from them and not pay any extra. We also have a Costco card but I struggle with it because I always overbuy when I’m there and make impulse purchases. 

I am a good cook and make almost all of our meals. I also am good at making freezer bag meals for our crock pot. The issue is with two small children I really need to stay on top / ahead of things because I don’t have a lot of time to prep stuff. 

We are omnivores and I try to make us healthy meals. 

Does anyone have any tips or tricks?

Edit to add: spelling- I make freezer bag meals, not freezer bagels lol. Also we live in South Carolina. Thank you all for your advice!

Edit 2.0: Thanks especially to the person who works at harris teeter who told me about e-VIC coupons and the person who shared the article from buzzfeed who spends $120/week for her family of 5 cause that was exactly what I needed. I was able to get all my groceries today for the week for $153.  I used e-VIC coupons at harris teeter and built our meals around their weekly ad. Igot 59 items that were a total of $230 and had almost $80 in savings.

If you're eating turkey today, you might be thinking about how you're gonna get through all the leftovers!! I did my turkey last Saturday, so I've been making leftovers all week...this was a really easy way to eat it..especially a few days later when you're super sick of turkey, and the leftovers are kinda drying out, lol. A spicy curry adds a little bit of new life to the meat!

Here's what you need:

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced into thin wedges
* 1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1 tablespoon butter or ghee
* 2 tablespoons curry powder or garam masala, depending on your preference
* Cayenne powder or crushed red pepper, optional, to taste
* 2½ cups leftover turkey, diced into bite-sized cubes
* 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 1 cup water or chicken stock, plus more if needed
* 15-ounce can coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cooked basmati rice and sliced scallions, for serving

Cook the onion and potatoes:

1. Heat the natural oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the sliced onion and diced potatoes and season all over with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, for 6–7 minutes.

Bloom the spices:

1. Create a well in the middle of the pot. Melt the butter into the open spot. Once bubbly, add the curry powder and cayenne powder. Cook, stirring it into the butter for 1 minute until fragrant. Toss the potatoes and onions in the spices.

Cook the turkey:

1. Add the turkey to the pot and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Simmer the curry:

1. Pour in the water or chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add the crushed tomatoes. Simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. Add more water as needed.

Finish the curry:

1. Taste the curry and season again to your preferences. Pour in the coconut milk and simmer 5 minutes more. Turn off the heat.

To serve:

1. Serve the turkey curry over cooked basmati rice and garnish with scallions or cilantro. Enjoy!",2022-11-24 22:16:48

Thanksgiving leftovers transformed into a yummy bowl of udon!,90,z2bf52,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z2bf52/thanksgiving_leftovers_transformed_into_a_yummy/,7,1669166682.0,"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/ZyvPuOG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZyvPuOG.jpg)

I did my thanksgiving this past Saturday and have turkey coming out of my ears. I've been trying to come up with creative ways to use up leftovers that go beyond the leftover sandwich or turkey salad. I decided to try out a quick noodle soup, and it was amaaaazing. I almost liked this soup better than my whole turkey dinner, lol!

**NOTE:** Don't be an idiot like me and throw away your turkey carcass. Save it and make stock from it. I was exhausted from cooking, and I just completely spaced out while I was cleaning up. You can make the turkey stock and then use it as the base for this soup instead of store-bought chicken stock or water.

It's a pretty easy recipe to riff on, depending on what you have leftover from your turkey dinner. If you don't have shichimi togarashi or chili oil, I made some suggestions for more accessible pantry options!

For the tamari, mirin, sesame oil, and miso -  just use whatever combination of ingredients you have. I you don't have miso, I don't think you need to run out and grab a tub specifically for this recipe. Just add a little extra tamari. Just my 2 cents! There are a million different ways you could make this, but if you haven't tried mixing chili oil into leftover cranberry sauce and using it as a noodle topping...whew. you're missing out!! it's soooo good!

Here's what you need for the soup:

* 1 orange, divided
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2 large shallots or 1 yellow onion, peeled and thinly sliced into wedges
* 8 cups water, turkey stock, or chicken stock
* 2½ cups leftover turkey, cut into bite-sized pieces
* ½ cup prepared cranberry sauce
* 2 carrots, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks
* Chili oil and/or shichimi togarashi (see substitution suggestions below in recipe)
* 12 ounces noodles of choice, cooked according to package instructions
* 4 eggs, optional, for serving
* 1/4 cup tamari or low-sodium soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon mirin or use a pinch of sugar and a splash of rice vinegar
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon miso
* Salt and pepper

Prepare the orange:

1. Use a peeler to peel off 3 small strips of orange zest and set them aside. Juice the orange into a bowl.

Cook the broth:

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil into a large pot over medium heat. Add the shallot or onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5–6 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the orange zest and half the orange juice. If you have shichimi togarashi, add a few sprinkles of it now. If not, add a touch of crushed red pepper if you like. Pour in the stock or water. Season with salt and pepper, and then bring to a boil. Reduce heat, add the turkey, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Prepare the cranberry sauce and carrots:

1. Place the cranberries in a small saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Once they begin to bubble, reduce the heat to low and add the remaining orange juice. Add the chili oil or crushed red pepper, and a shake or two of shichimi togarashi f you have it. If you don't have shichimi, you can add a sprinkle of sesame seeds here. Let simmer for 10 minutes.
2. Combine the carrots in a bowl and add a sprinkle of salt. Drizzle with 1–2 teaspoons of chili oil (if you don't have chili oil, add sesame oil and a pinch of crushed red pepper). Toss to coat and set aside.

Cook the noodles and eggs:

1. While the broth simmers, prepare the noodles according to package instructions. Cook the eggs for 8 minutes in low-boiling water and then add to ice bath. Peel and then halve lengthwise. Set aside.

Finish the broth:

1. Taste the broth and stir in the tamari, mirin, sesame oil, and miso. Once the miso has melted into the broth, turn off the heat. Taste and season once more.

To serve:

1. Divide cooked noodles between bowls and place two egg halves on top. Ladle the turkey and broth on top. Serve with cranberry sauce and sliced carrots on top. Enjoy!",2022-11-23 03:24:42

I’m from Jamaica and rice is a pretty big staple side there and is, unfortunately, what I’ve grown accustomed to making and eating with a lot of the meals I make. One of the biggest things that makes it hard for me too is how easy it is to just throw it and a couple other ingredients into a rice cooker and have a ton at hand. 

My question is, what alternatives have you used to replace rice in your meals and what helped you to stop eating as much of it? Thanks in advance!

I'm a student with a pretty small budget for food, and I'm pretty bad with regular eating, and ever since the last two years or so my diet has been abysmal. I think i need some advice to get back on my feet.

I eat pretty much one big meal a day, and it's usually something high in carbs that i can throw together like a pizza, rice and chicken, et cetera. Eating far fewer carbs is a goal for me.

Ideally, I'd like to not have to focus on what to eat on the daily, so perhaps i should prepare a week's meals on a specific day? If so, what kind of recipe could you eat every day and remain healthy? 

Is the ideal to prep two meals per day, lunch and dinner? Should these meals be different recipes, for a well-rounded diet or are there single recipes that basically fullfill a well-rounded diet?

In terms of carbs, i want to give a low-carb diet a try. I feel quite bad, physically and mentally, and I've no doubt I'll never get better if i don't try to make some changes. I also basically never drink water, just a 1.5L coke, which is insane, i know that. But it's just how I've been, and can't keep being. 
Does anyone have any tips for fluids? I know smoothies are pretty popular, where do they fit into people's diets, though? What do they gain from drinking a smoothie? How much water do people drink a day?

I don't get much joy out of eating per-se, i wish there was a pill i could take that fullfills my dietary needs.

Looking for light dinners,29,z194yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/z194yp/looking_for_light_dinners/,43,1669062132.0,"TL;DR: Are there any light dinners (even lunches that I could have for dinner instead) that you enjoy and that make you feel good?

I'd like to preface this brainstorming session with some (hopefully) relevant background.

I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD, and have also recently started stimulant medication that has reduced my appetite and affected how certain food makes me feel. On the plus side, I now have more motivation to prepare food myself. Additionally, while I'm pretty adventurous with food and will try anything once (pig intestines anyone?), I'd like to be able to enjoy my regular meals, whether that's in how it tastes, how it feels in my mouth, or how it makes my body and mind feel.

My psychiatrist suggested that I take the opportunity while my medication settles in to improve my diet. For the last 3 weeks, my breakfast has been porridge with skim milk, chia seeds, manuka honey, unsweetened Greek yogurt, cinnamon, and a couple of strawberries (and a gold kiwifruit if I'm feeling fancy). My lunch has been one sandwich on wholemeal bread, with a slice of Edam cheese, shaved roast chicken, cherry tomatoes, mixed salad greens and herbs, a small amount of avocado, a small amount of beetroot hummus, and a small amount of tomato or onion relish for flavour. I also have unsalted cashews or carrots in case I need a snack. I've absolutely loved these foods and they make me feel really good after eating them, and at no point have I felt starved or like I'm depriving myself. I've lost 2.5kg in a week and a half, and yet I feel like these meals are sustainable for me long-term.

Now to the problem I'm having...

What I'm struggling with is dinner. For a long while, my boyfriend and I succumbed to Uber Eats EVERY NIGHT. Sometimes even twice a day. I probably don't need to tell you how sad our bank balances looked. We used to do stir fries with lots of veggies, and we'd make our own sauce (soy sauce, oyster sauce, cornflour, sugar, Chinese cooking wine, chili in oil, garlic and white pepper), so I thought that would be a good thing to go back to... Now, they make me feel stodgy and bloated. The sauce is too salty, even if I reduce the soy sauce and top it up with water. I even reduced the amount of meat I put in and topped up with vegetables instead. We've also tried slow cooked meals, but I find them too heavy, too salty, and too tangy.

So I'm looking for advice on cost effective but nutritious, light dinner options. I would be more than happy to repeat my lunches for my dinners, but that wouldn't suit my boyfriend and it would mean I'm not using that meal to add more variety to our diet. I've done a bit of a Google and have found a lot of recipes for salads and things but I've gotten myself super overwhelmed with the sheer number of options, and my propensity to overanalyse and overplan has kicked in. I love Chinese, Malaysian, and Japanese food, as well as Italian food. I also like western food too. Not sure if it's relevant to the cost/availability of different ingredients, but I'm in New Zealand, and we're coming in to summer.",2022-11-21 22:22:12

Spanish lentil stew (vegan),866,yzclxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yzclxn/spanish_lentil_stew_vegan/,52,1668866680.0,"I'm USA born and bred but have been living in Spain for over 8 years now.  This is a classic family meal here and it fits right into the category of ""cheap and healthy"", not to mention ""delicious""!

What you need:

\-Assorted veggies (carrot, celery, leek, turnip, potato, etc.)

\-Large onion

\-6 cloves of garlic

\-Brown lentils (uncooked)

\-Veggie broth (optional)

\-A couple of bay leaves

\-Olive oil

\-Paprika

&#x200B;

Recipe:

1. Wash and chop your veggies and throw them in a big pot (except the onion).  I don't peel the carrots because I'm lazy.  Add the 6 whole cloves of garlic, unpeeled.
2. Wash and strain lentils.  100g is about one bowl.  For this recipe I use about 600-800g which lasts me 3-4 days. Add lentils to pot.  Add a couple of bay leaves too.  Add veggie broth if using, and/or water.  The rule is the liquid should be 3 fingers width above the ingredients.
3. Dice the onion then sauté in olive oil until gold and soft.  You don't necessarily want a lot of browning.
4. Add smoked paprika.  A lot of it.  Sauté a minute or two more.
5. Add onions to the pot.  I give it a good stir.
6. You'll want to be simmering low and slow for about 45 minutes or until lentils are soft but still have a bite to them.  Check on the stew every now and then to make sure you've got enough liquid in there.  You also want to remove the ""foam"" at the top with a skimmer every now and then.
7. After 45 minutes fish out your garlic cloves.  Be careful, they're hot!  Peel them when you can then crush them into a mash with a spoon.  Add back to the pot and give it a good stir.
8. Salt to taste.

The stew is usually delicious as-is but you can also drizzle your bowl with some white wine vinegar.  I like adding original Tabasco as well given that it's very vinegar forward - it works well and gives it a nice kick.

For meat lovers out there the traditional Spanish recipe calls for Spanish (not Mexican!) chorizo.  That's basically sausage links cut up and cooked in the stew.  You could use any kind of sausage really but it's supposed to be links not crumbles.  Me personally I'm pescetarian so I don't eat it with chorizo.  Anyway, this meal has all the nutrients you need without any meat so I don't view it as necessary.  To each their own, though!

Finally, wouldn't be a complete Spanish meal without some bread on the side.

Enjoy!

It’s even easier if you have a rice cooker (seriously, it’s worth every penny).

The easiest variation is just rice + frozen vegetables + sauce of choice. I just threw some frozen mixed vegetables in a pan to reheat them, put them on top of rice with a fried egg and added soy sauce and red pepper. It’s delicious. It’s such a cheap, versatile, easy formula to stick to.

Get a little fancier and:

roast a big pan of fresh vegetables
-switch up the protein (get some pre-drained tofu or a rotisserie chicken for added ease)
-get a bottle of pre-made sauce (peanut sauce is my favorite)

1 1/2 cup frozen mixed vegetables
1 or 2 eggs
1 tbsp soy sauce
2tsp cooking oil of choice

So I’ve been getting into eating walnuts and pumpkin seeds. Big bulk of the former and a salted pack of the latter were cheap at my local farmers market so I picked em up and have been using em for a replacement snack when I want something salty but also want to be satiated. I’ll have a serving of walnuts and a serving of pumpkin seeds (comes out to around 350 calories or so), and it works well for me.

Well I was telling a friend this, they’re also big into health stuff, and they started getting on my case about nuts and seeds being “too high in fat”, and was referencing the whole uproar over seed oils. I will concede that I’m a bit weary of canola or safflower oil, but as I don’t eat fried food often—and the main concern seems to be its heavy processing—it doesn’t feel like an issue for me.

A slight problem though, is I lack severe cooking skills. I have an instant pot that has a rice setting, and I've used that but that's about all the cooking experience I have. And am needing help to not be a complete idiot.

I plan on heading to the store tonight to pick up a large bag of rice and some beans, but do I grab canned beans or an also similarly large bag of beans? Anything else to grab to make the cooking better? And then, how do I cook said beans? Do I cook them at the same time with the rice in the instant pot or do I have them separate? This is probably really dumb and I apologize, but I've never really cooked for myself ever.

Thanks for the answers and help in advance! Any other recommendations would also be greatly appreciated!",2022-11-16 04:17:09

"Quick, simple, healthy meals without processed foods?",7,yw70j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yw70j9/quick_simple_healthy_meals_without_processed_foods/,9,1668540394.0,"I know how to cook. A little too well, apparently. The deal is that I do the cooking and my wife does the dishes. The food is good, but my wife regularly complains about the dishes since my menus tend to be a bit elaborate at times (i.e. lots of dishes).

Part of the reason for it is that my wife is a super picky eater and many things have to be prepared a certain way for so she'll eat them (with minimal complaining). The other part of it is that I (long story short: cancer, survived) have anywhere from little to no sense of taste or smell. I also come from a family with a strong culinary tradition. If I can't enjoy eating food, I can at least enjoy the process of creating it.

But, she's sick of dishes and I'm sick of the complaining about dishes. I figured I'd create a win-win (sorta) and just cut down to simple and quick meals. Simple will cut down on the dishes and quick because if I'm making boring food, I want to spend as little of my time as possible cooking.

I'm not really sure how to do this, though. For example, I have a ton of crock pot recipes, but none of them are complete healthy meals where I just throw a ton of crap in a crock pot, set it, and forget it. Everything I know is part of a more complicated meal. Like, I'll use the crock pot to make homemade bbq sauce, the convection toaster to bake up some quinoa, and then the oven to bring that and other ingredients together to make a BBQ turkey and kale meatloaf (with homemade cornbread on the side). If I just threw it all together in the crock pot to make some kind of BBQ meatloaf stew, that would be kinda gross.

So, I'm looking for ideas for things that I can either just toss in the crock pot and leave it or throw in a baking dish with no pre-cooking the result in complete meals with a good macro balance and plenty of nutrients. The only caveats are no dairy (wife is lactose intolerant and lactaid doesn't even help) and no cooked carrots (it's the one thing I don't eat).

You have to buy a minimum of $35 in other groceries but that' s easy to hit just replenishing basics. Different stores have different versions of this so I would do some shopping around in your area. Once you have it you can roast it and take all the meat off for sandwiches or whatever you want, and use the carcass to make a turkey stock and use the rest of the meat for soup!

Costco fish for the win!,1798,yvy0vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yvy0vi/costco_fish_for_the_win/,248,1668520774.0,"I live alone and I have been trying to eat healthier and spend less money on food. I decided to go to Costco, even though as a single person it didn't seem like a good idea because everything comes in bulk. However, the freezer is my friend and I had that epiphany while standing in the fish section. I bought a giant thing of steelhead trout for $30. Then I bought a bag of my favorite rice for about $15. Then I picked out a bunch of produce that I like and went home to start prepping.

I took all the produce and portioned it up into meal size portions and put them in the freezer. Then I took the fish and I weighed them out to about 3 or 4 oz pieces and that yielded about 9 pieces, which comes out to about $4 per slice of fish. I put each piece of fish into a reusable freezer bag and added my favorite marinade to each and then put them into the freezer.

When I get home from work I take the fish and the veggies out of the freezer and put it directly into the air fryer. I make rice in the instant pot. It all takes less than 20 minutes and it is such a yummy meal. I have been eating this every night for dinner and I feel like I unlocked the secret to easy and healthy meal prep, something I have been struggling with my entire life especially as someone who has ADHD.

My plan is to take this method and rinse and repeat. I can try different veggies, I can try different fish, when I get sick of fish I can try chicken or pork or something different. But everything freezes and that is what is really working for me right now, I highly recommend.

Also, I didn't want to pay for a Costco membership so I piggy backed on my friend's Costco run. But you could also take this approach and do this wherever you buy your food, I just found that places like wholesale Club or Walmart or Costco tend to be cheaper than going to Safeway or Save On for other regular grocery stores.",2022-11-15 15:59:34

Vegetarian Curry Chickpea and Lentil Soup

Serves 8+

&#x200B;

1 1/2 cups of dried, soaked, and prepared chickpeas, or 1 14 oz. can

1 cup of green lentils

3-4 carrots, large dice

1 medium yellow onion, large dice

3-4 garlic cloves, sliced or chopped

1 bag of baby spinach

1 can of coconut milk (I used lite because the full fat kind was almost $1 higher)

1 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes

6-8 cups of chicken or vegetable broth (more or less if you want thinner/thicker soup)

2-3 tsp curry powder (I use McCormick, it already has all the cumin, fenugreek, etc. that I need in one ingredient)

2 tsp. garlic powder

basmati or jasmine rice

Naan or pita

lemon wedges, sliced scallions, cilantro for garnish

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. Prepare your chickpeas according to the package if using dry and set aside. Alternately, start the lentils. I boiled them with the carrots for 10 minutes in a Dutch oven in a few cups of veg broth. This is the start of your soup base.

2. Pour the lentils, carrots and broth in with the chickpeas. In the Dutch oven or pot, saute onion in a little olive oil. Add garlic and watch closely so it does not burn. Pour chickpeas and lentil mix into this. Add your seasoning and tomatoes.

3. Add the remainder of your broth and bring to a low boil. Turn heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.

4. Add coconut milk and spinach. Cover again and simmer for another 5 minutes to wilt spinach.

5. Serve over basmati rice, garnish with lemon and scallions.",2022-11-14 20:29:50

I’ve been going to the gym three times a week thanks to my girlfriend pushing me, but still eating kinda like a trash fire because I feel like I can only put the minimal effort into food lately.

I know I haven’t responded to every comment, but I just wanted you to know I’ve read them all, and it means so much that you took the time to give helpful suggestions.

pineapple coconut curry,97,ytok6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ytok6l/pineapple_coconut_curry/,11,1668303817.0,"This is my recipe I've developed over the years. I grew up fairly poor and I used to make this for special occasions. It's pretty easy to make and you can change it however you like.

1 can of coconut milk
1 can of pineapple chunks
1 can of kidney beans
1 onion chopped
Spoonful of garlic
I put a single portion size of coconut Greek yogurt
(Or you can add instead sour cream, milk, or Greek yogurt. If you want to keep it vegan you can use coconut alternative milk)
(Any chopped vegetables you like)
I put:
1 sweet potato
1/4 of a bell pepper
Handful of sugar snap peas
(Add meat if you wish) 

Spices: 
1tbsp coriander
1tbsp cumin
1tbsp tumeric
1tsp pepper
(1tsp cayenne pepper if you like spicy)
1tsp garlic powder
1tsp minced onion
1tbsp parsley
1tsp paprika
(I am allergic to ginger so instead I put a pinch of cloves ) 

Put coconut milk, yogurt, pineapple and half of the pineapple can juice into your pot. Add chopped vegetables and spices and bring to a boil, stirring every so often. Once vegetables are soft add rinsed kidney beans and bring to a boil again stirring every so often on low heat for 5 minutes. Take off of heat and enjoy!

\- A whole fucking chicken. Spatchcocked and dry brined overnight, 1000w for 45 minutes. Tender, juicy, fully cooked chicken. Skin was as crispy as a grocery store cooked chicken, i.e. not crispy.

\- A whole potato for raclette: wrapped in wet paper towel, 15 minutes. Done, great.

Thought I would share an easy meal with you. Back in the late summer I made a delicious pulled-pork recipe for a party. The leftovers I froze in portions for two people, as it is just me and my wife here. I made a fajita-like dish on Friday night and a rice bowl the next day. 

Here is what I used- ingredients can be changed according to what you have on hand. 

* **Cooked rice** (I threw in a stock cube for flavour)
* **Oil or butter** for cooking
* Pinch of **salt**
* **Onion**, sliced
* **Bell peppers** (variety of colours, used up the frozen ones I had from when I had too many peppers to use up in time)
* **Leftover pulled-pork** (you could use shredded chicken, ground meats, sausage, whatever you want to try it with- it helps to have a sauce in it)
* **Shredded cheese and/or sour cream if desired.** 

I threw some oil in a pan and added my onion and bell pepper mix and added some salt. Cooked it until it was soft. Threw in the pulled-pork to heat up. On Friday we made our own tortillas and they turned out great- we added some sour cream and the veg/pork mix onto it. For today We our veg/pork mix over some rice. 

It was a big hit!",2022-11-12 22:46:45

Recipe here originally: [Lemon Chicken Couscous Soup](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/lemon-chicken-couscous-soup/)

I love making homemade chicken broth like this! If you work from home, this is a great thing to throw on the stove a couple of hours before you want to start dinner. If that's not feasible, it's a great weekend recipe!

I just let the chicken thighs simmer for 2 hours, and then I strain the liquid and pick the meat from the bones.

From there, it's just a super basic soup recipe -- celery, onion, some kind of seasoning salt (I used a blend that had fennel in it, but use your favorite here! You can also omit and just stick with good old salt and pepper!!)

You can also use rice instead of pearl couscous and just adjust the cooking time as needed. You can really modify this recipe in any number of ways. Throw in extra vegetables, like carrots or potatoes. Fresh or frozen peas with dill would also be delicious.  Mushrooms cooked with the onion and celery would never be a bad idea!!!

**Ingredients:**

* 8 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs
* Water
* 1 small bunch fresh parsley
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* Seasoning salt to taste, or use garlic pepper, lemon pepper, herbes de Provence, or your favorite seasoning salt
* 1 cup pearl couscous
* ⅓ cup fresh dill roughly chopped, plus more for serving
* 1 lemon juiced
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Oyster crackers or saltines for serving or serve with toasted bread
* Extra virgin olive oil for garnish

**Instructions:**

**Prepare the stock:**

* Place the chicken thighs in a 3.5-quart pot. Season all over with salt and place the parsley sprigs on top. Cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours.
* After 2 hours, remove the cover, remove the chicken from the pot, and transfer it to a bowl. Strain the liquid through a sieve into a large bowl. Discard the parsley sprigs, wipe out the pot, and return it to the stove.
* Remove the skins from the chicken thighs and discard. Pick the chicken from the bones and shred into bite-sized pieces. Transfer the meat to the bowl of stock. Discard the bones.

**Start the soup:**

* Heat the olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 5 minutes until it softens. Add the Cancale or your favorite seasoning salt and toss to coat.

**Simmer the soup:**

* Add the pearl couscous to the pot and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and the chicken. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes or until the couscous is tender. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Finish the soup:**

* Add the fresh dill and lemon juice to the pot and simmer for 5 minutes.

**To serve:**

* Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with dukkah or oyster crackers and serve with fresh dill scattered on top. Drizzle each bowl with a touch of extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy!",2022-11-11 23:13:03

He's just not great at things that require a lot of steps and work. A lot of times when he cooks we eat box meals or frozen meals. Something like hamburger helper or velveeta mix - he can do those easily. I tell him throw a bag of frozen veggies in and make it semi healthy. Other times he will just throw some nuggets or pizza rolls in the air fryer and that's dinner. Lately I've been pre-chopping and separating chicken breasts for him into portion sized bags, so I'll buy 5lbs of frozen chicken breast, let them partially thaw, cube them, and portion them into quart sized zippies and stack them in the freezer.

What are some other things I could do? We already buy frozen veggies of all types. Fresh stuff goes bad too fast, so we don't often get fresh veggies, but I'm always down for frozen or canned. I'm not a fan of re-heated food so I'm not ok with cooking all of it on the weekend and reheating it. Texture woes there. Would love to use a gallon sized zip lock bag to throw in all the needed spices, sauces, veggies, and meat and tell him just cook this and throw it over some rice or pasta for us.

5 easy ingredients and minimal prep

Please check my profile for more recipes and food tips.

Ingredients:

1. 10 tablespoons Honey (preferably raw honey) - can use 2/3 cup of Allulose for low carb
2. 5 large Eggs (eggs! eggs! eggs!)
3. 3 cups Whole Milk (can use Coconut Milk for low carb)
4. 2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract
5. A pinch of salt

Outside of perhaps the honey, these ingredients should not set you back much. 

Steps:

1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. a) If using Allulose: Heat Allulose in a small nonstick saucepan over medium heat until completely dissolved; shake and swirl the pan until Allulose has caramelized ; pour into a 1 1/2-quart baking dish, and swirl to coat the bottom of the dish evenly.

b) If using Honey: Take 6 tablespoons and coat the bottom of the 1 1/2-quart baking dish evenly, place in freezer for 5 minutes

3. In a small saucepan, add the milk and bring it to a boil. Once hot, reduce to a simmer for a further 2 minutes, before removing from the heat.

4. Whisk and combine thoroughly the milk, eggs, vanilla, salt and remaining 4 tablespoons honey. (if using Allulose add 1/3 cup in the milk on step 3) - you can also use a blender

5. Use a strainer to pour the mixture into the 1 1/2-quart baking dish - on top of the honey base or Allulose base

6. Place the baking dish into a deep roasting pan; pour in enough boiling water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.

7. Bake until Flan is set, around 40-50 minutes

Let cool, enjoy.",2022-11-10 17:37:07

I'm not a super coffee snob, but I can't do Folgers-level coffee and prefer a dark roast. It was a decent deal for what you got. It was 1-3/4 lbs. for $10. Just under $6 a pound was quite reasonable for a drinkable coffee.

It appears our local Whole Foods have stopped carrying it, and all they have left are other 365 coffees (in smaller packages for higher per-pound costs) and then all their designer coffees. I did see it was being sold on Amazon, but I like to check expiration dates on my food and we have had enough issues with Amazon in general lately.

So, we need to find a new brand. I know inflation is through the roof right now (and I'll probably be paying more whatever I get), but I'm not looking to break the bank on coffee. I'm not sure what else I can find that's a decent dark roast in this price range. Starbucks anything is definitely going to cost way more (and quite frankly, their coffees aren't even that great). We're in the northeast U.S., so Dunkin is technically an option, but I think (over time) they have overloaded all their coffees with chicory (to save on costs) so I don't think they are worth it, either.

From the Asian purple skinned to the classic American ""yams"". I just buy about 4 of whatever is cheapest. I look for chubby sweet potatoes all about the same size and shape.  

I prick them all over and then cook them in a covered glass bowl in the microwave with about 1/4 cup of water for 7-10 min - until they give when you squish them a bit, but not totally squishy. Once coolish enough to handle I smear them with a little olive oil (or butter, or spray oil stuff) and spices -  try salt and pepper, or Penzy's seasoned salt plus an herb mix, or even Old Bay and some mixed Italian herbs - whatever you like. You want them pretty well seasoned. Then I bake them with foil on the tray for about 10 min at 350 deg F to crisp up the skin and drive off the moisture a bit. You could just bake them about 45-60 min, but I'm always impatient.  

Now you can just let them cool, and wrap up in the foil they cooked in and store them in the fridge as a fabulous meal prep! Or go straight to the toppings below.  

* I always I cut them down the middle longways and fluff up the inside a bit. Then add some more seasonings inside and a dab of butter or olive oil - you can microwave that and it's a perfectly good side dish or snack. This is the basic sweet tater that is good any time. 
* For breakfast add a poached or fried egg on top of a basic sweet tater heated up
* For lunch I like to add a bit of cheese to the basic sweet tater, nuke it, then pile on some cottage cheese, with TJs everything but the bagel seasoning on top.  Queso fresco would be good instead of cottage cheese. Ooh and some avocado.
* Or just go full on loaded baked potato on the basic sweet tater - some cream cheese, shredded cheese, bacon bits, sour cream
* Or try some steamed broccoli and cheese sauce or white sauce on top and lots of black pepper.
* Or take it easy and open a can of baked beans over a basic sweet tater.",2022-11-09 21:35:24

Ingredients:

- One cup water
- EDIT: 1/4 tsp salt
- Half cup old fashioned oats
- Two tablespoons apple sauce
- One tablespoon puréed pumpkin
- Teaspoon of cinnamon
- Half tablespoon peanut butter
- Splash (or more) of milk or milk alternative 
- Drizzle (or more) of honey 

Directions:

Bring salted water to boil. Add the oatmeal, apple sauce, pumpkin purée and cinnamon and bring down to a simmer. Cook 3-5 minutes, covered or uncovered depending how watery or creamy you’d like (covered will be more creamy). Take off the heat, pour oats into your bowl and top with peanut butter, milk of choice (I go for oatception and use oat milk), and as much honey as your sweet tooth would like.

Sweet potato gnocchi works surprisingly well,49,yp519m,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yp519m/sweet_potato_gnocchi_works_surprisingly_well/,5,1667864866.0,"It's a little time intensive and messy, but you can prepare a lot of this and freeze it in advance. It's particularly nice for freezing because you don't have to dethaw before cooking, just toss a portion in a pot of boiling water and scoop them into a frying pan when they float to the top. I segment out a portion in rows and wrap them in wax paper and put every batch in a single plastic bag.

What I like about having this around is that goes well with anything I might have on hand or want to eat that week. Make a simple base with butter and milk and add whatever spices you want, some cheese for protein, and then add vegetables, beans, meats, etc.

Don't have a specific recipe. General ratio I've seen is \~1.5 cups of flour, 1 egg, and 1/2 cup ricotta or whatever other cheese (cottage, parmesan, etc.) per 1lbs of sweet potato. You want to avoid mashing the potato, just work the in the flour in stages until you get a fairly dry dough. If you work the dough to the point that the flour is fully incorporated, it will be way too sticky. Maybe someone has a better technique, that's just how I've done it.

I have been raised a vegetarian and don’t take eggs either, so any meat is out of the question. I had some questions about diet and food.

1. I’m trying to cut added sugars from my diet. Is it advisable to completely stop eating any sugar (that is go on a detox) until your levels are more normal? Furthermore, is it okay to cut added sugar and only get sugar from fruits and vegetables- would it cause any deficiencies? Is a zero added sugar life even possible without making massive compromises on time and money?

2. For breakfast whenever I’m having toast it’s the cheapest whole wheat flour bread from the grocery store. But honestly I don’t see anything unhealthy in the ingredients except the 1g added sugar - I’m guessing since the bread is so cheap it’s pretty unhealthy? I’ve attached an image of the ingredients on the bread packet for reference. 

3. For lunch it’s whole wheat flour tortillas again from the store and cooked vegetables on the side (like an Indian roti sabji, which is what I grew up eating). Are those tortillas bad too? I’d prefer to make rotis at home but there’s no time with a busy work schedule. Attached ingredients image again.

4. I buy packed salads but they have these sugary or eggy dressings I don’t like, so I just eat the veggies. However the raw green veggies don’t go well with my stomach (even with sauces in them) and I’m wondering if there is any way to get the body used to it - or should I stop eating salads altogether? I love having a side of salad (like cabbage and carrot slaw) for lunch but can only eat a little otherwise it’s a run to the bathroom. Is there any healthy dressing I can make?

5. Honestly I feel pretty okay even if I’m eating a lot of sugar and junk. I think it’s because as a kid I ate what my mom cooked for me no questions, and eating out was something we did once a month mostly. Plus my metabolism is pretty fast too so I feel hungry often and thus eat a lot. How do I then know if these diet changes are making a positive impact on me?

Hard-boil some eggs to eat with the sandwich (on the side ya dummies!)

I've seen different research but I try to limit myself to 3 eggs a day, even if that's not true I don't see any reason to be wolfing down 7 or 8 unless it's a rare occasion.

Can these salad ingredients last all week if we chop them and store them in a jar?,3,yor4hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yor4hv/can_these_salad_ingredients_last_all_week_if_we/,12,1667836551.0,"Hi, my partner and I recently travelled to the States and saw a vending machine that sells salads in jars that were made ahead of time. We really like the idea and want to start making our own salads that can last 5-7 days so we don't need to cook on weekdays. Our idea is to chop all the ingredients first and put them in jars to store in the refrigerator, but we are not sure whether the ingredients we pick can last all week or not after we chop them and place them together in a jar. 

The ingredients we chose are as follows: cucumbers, Italian rotini, cherry tomatoes, cabbages, lettuce, apples, boiled eggs, some nuts, hams, and grilled chicken breasts. For Salad dressings, we are thinking about olive oil, greek yogurt, black pepper, lemon juice, etc.

Sorry if this is a stupid question. We don't usually eat and store salads. Any other ingredient recommendations are welcome. Thank you in advance!",2022-11-07 17:55:51

I am a 32 year old man living in Bangladesh. Due to severe OCD for the past 15 years or so I have lived a very dependent lifestyle with other people doing the cooking for me. I cannot cook at all, other than boil rice and make an omellette. 

Now as part of my becoming independent self-training program, I would like to learn basic cooking skills where I can cook up a healthy breakfast, lunch, dinner or other snacks using whatever is available in the local market and in season. That means the training should not be cuisine dependent. Instead, the training should be such that I can make a healthy meal whether I am in China, the US, a country in Eastern Africa or Bangladesh. 

The meals should be both cheap and healthy. 

I am out of home for 70 hours a week so I do not have time to go through entire YouTube playlists or books. Therefore I am looking for a few page booklet or an hour or two of YouTube video that can teach me this skill. 

Also, dietary restriction wise I avoid dairy, caffeine and I prefer fish and less of beef. 

Can someone suggest a booklet or YouTube video that can teach me these skills and that I can practice using the ingredients available in Bangladesh? 

Here is a link to what is typically available in Bangladesh: https://chaldal.com/food

Can someone suggest something based on Chinese, Thai or Indian cuisine? Those ingredients are more likely to be available in Bangladesh.",2022-11-05 16:15:11
Is celery as a snack filling despite low calories?,2,ymmt54,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ymmt54/is_celery_as_a_snack_filling_despite_low_calories/,9,1667631885.0,"I have to cut down on weight. I bought a bunch of fruits and vegetables, with the idea of snacking on a head of lettuce any time I thought about eating Doritos or Goldfish. 

To my shame, most of those fruits and vegetables expired before I touched them. One that stuck with me was pre-cut celery. I always liked celery as a kid, and despite a long drought between eating plain celery as a kid and eating plain celery at 26 years old, it was something I felt good about eating. With the calorie count as low as it was, and how satisfying it was to eat, I felt like I could definitely replace my normal unhealthy snacks with celery. The only real downside is the expiration dates. 

What I'm wondering is whether celery, at such a lower calorie count, is as filling as my typical snacks which carry 100+ calorie counts per relatively small serving size. If a single pre-cut celery stick is less than 5 calories, and 16 Doritos chips are 100 calories, do I have to eat 20 celery sticks to feel as full as I would eating 16 Doritos chips? 

The whole point of switching to lower-calorie fruits and veggies is to lower my overall caloric intake. If celery and chips require the same number of calories to make me feel ""full"", then the only benefit is that celery is inherently healthier than chips. I'm consuming the same number of calories as I was before.",2022-11-05 09:04:45

However, just because I look healthy doesn't mean that I am.  I eat like absolute trash and I think its finally catching up to me.  I would also like to be able to stand up without feeling like the room is closing in on me.

• pretty much any meat (it freaks me out, I'm not sure why)
• pretty much any vegetable (same idea)

Edit: sounds like I messed up this batch when I put them in the fridge. I’m gonna give it one last try (brought my IP to work today lol) and pressure cook them on normal for 40 minutes then do a natural release. I really wanted these beans!!!

But, I need variety in my diet: unlike some bodybuilders, I can’t eat the same thing every day. Even with delicious foods like chicken thighs or legs, I get sick of them after a few days. Then I end up binging/cheating on my diet with other foods. Plus, in my opinion, eating the same thing every single day defeats the point of IIFYM.

However, I also agree with the sentiment that if I’m a bachelor just feeding myself, I shouldn’t really be spending more than $50 a week at the grocery store. My grocery bills are really high sometimes.

How can I do this so that I get the variety in my diet while not spending insane amounts of money? Maybe I could give myself a spending cap of $200 a month, and be flexible within that range. That way, I could eat what I want and not waste a ton of extra money on food.",2022-10-31 19:54:54

Balanced 1 pot recipes?,9,yh72x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yh72x3/balanced_1_pot_recipes/,16,1667112736.0,"I'm very inexperienced at cooking, I don't have a lot of time and I hate cooking meat (I distrust it, I'm scared I'll get food poisoning. I can eat it if it's canned, like squid or tuna, or if someone I trust cooks it). I don't know how to fry and I only have a stove, a toaster oven and a microwave (technically there's a blender but I'm not savvy enough to use it).

That's why I'm looking for balanced meals (enough protein, fat and carbs) that are easy to cook by just dumping everything into a pot. I love strong flavours like garlic, onion, anchovies and spices (thyme, pepper, basil, chives), dislike spicy food, and lean towards Mediterranean cooking and seasoning (Spanish, Italian, french).

Some meals I cook are:
- Rice with squid in ink (sauteé a ton of garlic and onions, add a can of squid in ink, add brown rice, add wine and broth, bring to a boil, cover and let it cook).
- Lentil soup (sauteé onions, celery, carrots, and other hard veggies of your choice, add sliced tomatoes, add lentils, add water, add pureed tomatoes, add spices and cilantro, cook).
- Crustless quiche (add eggs, add milk, add veggies and bacon or ham if you're in the mood, add spices, bake).
- Sardines on rice (cook rice with veggies and spices, spread it in a toaster oven pan, put canned sardines on top, add spices, bake)
- Rice and beans (steal some rice cooked by mom, add a can of beans and veggies like onion or bell peppers, mix it and eat with corn tortillas. If you're feeling extra, add some panela or oaxaca cheese).
- Most mornings I eat a slice of bread with cottage cheese on top and some yogurt with fruit and granola. Sometimes mom will leave a hardboiled egg behind and I'll steal it too, for the protein.
- Some days cereal is the only thing keeping me alive.

This is what I have in my pantry. Game plan to make it last three weeks?,355,ydhkqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ydhkqr/this_is_what_i_have_in_my_pantry_game_plan_to/,153,1666736710.0,"

Okay. So I got covid and had to take more time off work than I wanted to. Unpaid. So that means my paycheck coming up is going to be pretty much non-existant. I spent $35 to buy some essentials, and also list what I already have in my house.

Ideas for a game plan to stretch it out 2-3 weeks, lunch and dinner?

NOTE: I cannot spend buy anything further than what's on this list

What I have:

- Quart Heavy Whipping Cream
- 8oz Shredded Parm
- 32oz Rice bag
- Pinto Beans & Country Ham Pieces
- 12 bone-in chicken thighs
- Half a bag of frozen peas
- Many cans of peas and corn
- 2-3lbs of russet potatoes 
- Loaf of wheat bread
- Many eggs (relatives own chickens) 
- 2 Butter sticks
- An embarrassing amount of pasta noodles. Spaghetti, farfalle, rotini, penne
- Milk gallon
- jar of minced garlic (I prefer fresh garlic, but this is what I have now.)
- Shredded cheddar cheese bag
- Maybe 1 onion
- 3 cans of really sketchy beef that my mom gave me. Just... Canned beef. Looks like cat food, smells like it, tastes blandly of roast beef and gravy
- Fully stocked spice rack, any cooking oils, flour, and sugar

I know that I can make some Alfredo pastas and like, cacio e pepe. But I can't eat pasta for 3 weeks straight. And I already plan on making a pot of soup beans with those ham pieces, which reheats really well.

Any recipe ideas jump out at you? Maybe things that can be batch cooked? I've always cooked with breasts, so I'm unfamiliar with thighs, so those intimidated me. But they were cheaper than breasts.

Edit: I checked this post this morning and I am blown away by all the responses. There's more here than I can respond to, but Tha k you so much for your kind ideas!",2022-10-26 01:25:10

- 3 tbsp veg oil
- 1 white or yellow onion, one half diced and the other half cut into quarters
- 5 cloves peeled garlic, three smashed or finely chopped
- 2 chicken thighs or chicken breasts
- 1 cup cheap white wine
- 2 tsp dried oregano or Mexican oregano
- 4 epazote leaves
- 3 carrots, sliced into rounds
- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 10 oz canned or fresh tomatoes, diced
- 1 7 oz can chipotles in adobo (this is fairly spicy, omit some or all if you need)
- 1 15 oz can chickpeas (or equivalent dried soaked chickpeas)
- 5 oz green beans, cut into 1-inch lengths
- Salt

To serve:
- Lime wedges
- Corn tortillas
- Queso fresco
- Cilantro
- 1 avocado


1. Add onion eighths, two peeled cloves of garlic, bay leaf, and two chicken thighs to a stock pot and braise ~2 mins or until browned. 
2. Add oregano and epazote, deglaze with wine (or water).
3. Add 8 cups water and simmer ~45 mins until stock is reduced by a quarter and chicken is tender.
4. Remove bay leaf and epazote and discard.
5. Remove chicken, shred, and set aside.
6. Immersion blend stock until mostly smooth and take off heat. (If no immersion blender is available, use heat-safe blender, or just smash the garlic and leave the onion.)
7. In separate pan, add 2 tbsp oil and carrots with half of the diced onion. Cook 5 mins until slightly softened.
8. Add cumin seeds and 3 cloves smashed garlic and cook until garlic is softened.
9. Add tomatoes and chipotles in adobo with sauce. Break up chipotles in pan.
10. When tomatoes are cooked down and carrots and onion are fragrant and mostly softened, add pan contents to stock along with shredded chicken and heat to boil.
11. Add chickpeas and green beans. Cook until green beans are done.
12. Salt to taste.
13. Take off heat and serve with remaining 1/4 diced onion, cilantro, lime cut into eighths, avocado sliced, corn tortillas, and queso fresco.

This recipe holds up well to substitutions and you can pretty much leave out almost any ingredient or two and still get a great soup. Yesterday when I made it I was missing chickpeas, green beans, and epazote and it was good enough to inspire me to make a rare post. Recipe stuck together out of multiple examples online (mostly [this one](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/caldo-tlalpeno-recipe/#recipe) and [this one](https://us.kiwilimon.com/recipe/soups/traditional-caldo-tlalpeno)) with some home soup making standards (braising stock ingredients, deglazing with wine, immersion blending to keep the good stuff in the pot).

I like to stand over the pot (as long as I can stand) to let the steam clear my sinuses. The spice helps with that a lot, too.

Makes something like 10 servings.",2022-10-25 16:24:05

With extracurriculars, partial work from office scenarios and overall craziness in this house, meal prep is always a struggle.

I was wondering if anyone has any kid friendly, inexpensive meal ideas to feed 3 kids and two adults that are also quick to make. I'm looking to create a weekly or biweekly menu that would help bring structure to the week and save on grocery runs and sudden expenses, along with eating out less and eating less packaged foods.

I want to be able to sit down with my partner and pick 5 meals out of a list and plan the grocery run for the week.

Meals that are common in the house are things like spaghetti, lasagna, frozen stuffed chickens, etc. Lasagna is very expensive where I'm from and so are the stuffed chickens or any ""healthy"" frozen foods. I also enjoy cooking so I don't mind menu items that take a bit of time to make. These items would be good when I'm working from home on evenings without extracurriculars. I would also dedicate time on Sundays for meal prep that requires a lot of time in the kitchen.

2- 3.4 oz packages of Jello Vanilla Instant pudding
1- 15 oz can of pumpkin puree
1/4 c light brown sugar
1/2 to 2 tsp of pumpkin spice or whatever individual spices you like (cinnamon, ginger, clove, nutmeg)
3 cups milk

**Ingredients**

* 3/4 cup of raw, uncooked oatmeal
* 1/2 cup cottage cheese
* 2-3 whole eggs
* Optional: Milk to help with the blender, and brown sugar if you need some extra flavor

Throw all things into a blender (pro tip: put eggs in first, then cottage cheese, then oatmeal on top).

What my research has said:
There exists categories of food where they share a similar amount of protein, carbs, or fat per some serving size (different for each food). Now to hit your goals, you just add up food types to hit the macro goals.

What I’m thinking:
All foods have all the macronutrients, so if you’re only counting the one macro per food for each macro type, then you could overshoot your calorie intake through the additional macros.
Example, I use chicken breast and see if has 27g of protein per 100g, then I add that to the protein for that meal, but now I have 73g of fat and carbs that I need to account for too, which makes me change 3 variables at once, which could get difficult to manage.

Especially now that I’m a budding home chef, I’d love to try adding new things to my pantry/diet, but I’m not sure if it’s actually unhealthy to do this. Also, it doesn’t seem that expensive. Any thoughts, tips or good reads out there? I’m very eager to try some Al pastor tacos and a chorizo burger, but don’t want to get sick 😩😂",2022-10-23 00:48:41

Pork,39,yaysnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/yaysnw/pork/,7,1666473146.0,"With the prices of beef and chicken climbing, pork is now a cheaper option. For me, anyway. So I've been cooking lots of pork. 

I buy a large pork roast. This will make 3 meals. 

First, I make pork roast in the slow cooker.

Line the bottom of the pot with sliced onion. (If you want the onions in the gravy later, dice them smaller.)

Apply your favorite rub to the pork. Let sit for about 30 minutes, or whatever your rub recommends. Place pork in the pot. Carefully pour about two cups of broth (vegetable or chicken or bone) or water around the pork. 

Cover and cook 7-8 hours on high. 

If you want gravy, remove the roast. Then remove any remaining pieces of fat and such that you don't want in the gravy. Mix a teaspoon of corn starch in a bit of water to make a slurry, and mix into the pot. Let heat for about 5 minutes to thicken. 

I slice about 1/3  of the roast and serve with the gravy or with warm applesauce. Usually with roast potatoes and broccoli on the side.

Take half of the remaining roast and shred with two forks. Discard the fat, if you like. Mix shredded pork with your favorite BBQ sauce. (If you don't have any on hand, a quick and dirty sauce can be made by mixing 2/3 catsup and 1/3 worchestershire sauce.) 

I pop this into the fridge overnight to help the flavors meld, then heat and serve on toasted buns. I add a side of coleslaw and a scoop of beans. 

The last piece of the pork roast gets cubed. I use it to make carnitas or chili Verde. Just because the spicy flavors make a nice change from the previous. Most any recipe will work. Just adjust for already cooked meat.",2022-10-23 00:12:26

- I haven't lost any vegetation due to spoilage in over 6 months (when I started doing this). No wasted money!
- Cooking has been super easy and quick since everything is pre-cut.

I had an epiphany: Make chicken broth in a slow cooker while I'm at work,741,y9qsxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y9qsxh/i_had_an_epiphany_make_chicken_broth_in_a_slow/,101,1666350316.0,"I love how versatile rotisserie chickens are. They're cheap, already cooked, they're a good healthy comfort food if you don't have too much of the skin. With the meat you can make so many different things and with the bones i love making bone broth

When I get one I'll have some of the meat for dinner and then immediately get to taking all the meat off and shredding it up so it can cool down. If I'm going to make broth within a couple days I'll keep the bones in the fridge, or freeze if I don't plan on it for a while

This whole week has been cold and rainy, perfect soup weather. But when I get home from work it's too late to have broth simmering for hours and hours to have soup for dinner. This morning i thought duh, I'll use my croc pot. After finding some recipes that confirmed i can actually do this, and finding out that there is a slow cooker subreddit /r/slowcooking , I'll be looking forward to dope broth when I get out of work

Broth:

-bones
-veggies (traditional is onion/celery/carrot, I've seen peppers, mushroom, garlic added to broths though)
-salt +pepper
-herbs
-slow cooker

If you want the ultimate broth, roast the bones and veggies beforehand. If not that's fine, do it when you have the time or when you want to take a trip to Flavortown. Put everything in a slow cooker and cover with a generous amount of water. Depending on how long it'll simmer for you can fill it to the top with water. If you'll have it simmering for 12+ hours, fill to the top. If you won't or if you don't have that much stuff going into it, fill to the top of your little carcass pile and add a generous few inches extra of water

As for amounts of veggies, i eyeball. One chicken carcass, maybe a couple medium sized onion, a few stalks of celery, four medium sized carrot, that's around what I would do. Do it to your tastes though or however much room you have in the slow cooker, there are no rules here (except food safety). Cook on low at least 8h, preferably 12h. The longer you cook the more flavor and nutrients you'll get

You know you made a real bone broth if it's gelatinized when cooled. The collagen cooks out of the bones, joints, and muscle and turns into gelatin. This is why I like making broth when I have the time, if you cook it low and slow you'll end up with something that has a lot of flavor and protein

When it's cooled you can skim any fat off of the top to since it's less dense and will solidify, much easier than when it's hot. And you can use any bones, not just chicken. If you're using beef bones (which you can actually buy straight up from a grocery store, my local one sells them anyway in the frozen section), you definitely want to roast those before cooking into a broth. The flavor would be amazing. And simmer at least 12 hours, up to 24, since they're much bigger than chicken bones. Pork bones would be great too for pho or ramen",2022-10-21 14:05:16

I figured you cook them for a few minutes since they're not quick oats, but nope.

So i read what a serving is, 1/4 cup, put that in this glass storage bowl thing with some blueberries and covered with soy milk, adding in extra so all the oats could absorb the milk. If I have to cook it in the morning for a minute so be it, i was going to eat it hot anyway

The next morning the oats are kinda edible but could use some softening up. In a pot on the stove they cooked for about five minutes, and i added a little water because they did absorb a lot of the milk.

Buy corn fakes, rice puffs , wheetabix or wheat puffs (well the ones that have no to very little sugar in them) depending on your couties and add cut fruits in them for the sweetness and health benefits. Apples, pears, grapes, bananas... Berries you name it!
Cheaper option or how to trcik your kids (lol)? Mix apple sauce (unsweetened) to your milk, or blend a banana milk (cow plant you choose) and cacao for healthier milk chocolate. 

An other option is to make your own crunchy granola with you guessed it either blended bananas or applesauce (for the sweetness) just enought for the oats to be moist,  and you can add seeds or/and nuts then flaten it thin on a tray hop in the oven , flip and back (maybe 15 minutes) and you will get some healthy granola (more like oats flakes but still)

Do not forget a pinch of salt makes these taste sweeter than they are! Also you can add spices such as anis, cinamon, cardamom...etc

Raisins etc might be great for some but really it is high in sugar so Really fresh fruits is better!

Edit just want to clarify few things.

When you say healthier it means more healthy like cake could be healthier, chips too, jam etc! Healthy and healthier have different meanings . Just saying.

Also unless you eat a raw diet , your food is more or less processed . Soup is processed food, it was cooked added salt etc to it and blended it. That does not mean soup is unhealthy. Same if you eat wholewheat bread, multigrain bread, pasta, quinoa or red lentil pasta that is procecessed too. Just saying.",2022-10-20 09:38:09

Never eaten a fruit or vegetable in my life,112,y8ddsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y8ddsa/never_eaten_a_fruit_or_vegetable_in_my_life/,179,1666211298.0,"**not sure if this is the right subreddit for this or if I am breaking any rules, but didn’t know where else I should post this

Basically title. I’m M19, about 6”1 160 lb, exercise somewhat but not as much as I should. For most of my life I have been in great health, diet has consisted of a lot of meats (chicken, beef, pork etc.), cheeses, pasta, breads, and pizza, but have probably not eaten a single fruit or vegetable since I was a baby. I’ve always been an extremely picky eater and suspect I may have some sort of sensory processing problem in regards to textures and consistency of food, because certain fruits and vegetables I have tried and have barely been able to get one bite down without gagging. The taste is usually not what bothers me but the texture and consistency. 

I’m currently studying abroad in Italy and due to a relatively heavy course load I have been very busy and under more stress than I was used to in highschool. In the past few weeks I have noticed I am feeling more run down and lethargic throughout the day, more so than usual. I attribute this partially to the stress I am currently under, but also wonder if my diet is finally catching up to me. Upon doing some research, this seems plausible, and even if it is not the case I want to change my diet as I read that lack of fruits and vegetables can cause basically the worst afflictions possible ie cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, hemorrhoids, and even scurvy

I want to start changing my diet to be more healthy and nutritious, but am not sure where to start, and don’t have much time between classes, homework, and studying to prepare meals.

So in order to keep my vegetable intake up without constantly going shopping and spending money on vegetables I’m ultimately not going to eat, I buy frozen vegetables. Not only are frozen vegetables just as nutritious and stay fresh until the end of time, in comparison to fresh they are cheaper per unit as well.

Currently I’m on a spinach trip, and this is what I had last night for dinner:


Potatoes, cut in 1/4s

Crème fraîche

Olive oil

Paprika powder 

Garlic powder


Toss the potatoes in a bowl with enough olive oil, paprika and garlic powder, and salt to coat them. Roast on a sheet of baking paper at ca. 200•c (use fan forced if you have it).
Check them with a knife after 30 minutes. At some point the outside should be a bit crispy, and the inside soft.
Serve with crème fraîche.

Frozen spinach (5 cubes)

Frozen peas (ca. 1 cup)

2 medium onions, chopped 

Ca. 100g smoked tofu, cubed

Olive oil


Fry all that in olive oil. I like to start with the onions, then throw in the spinach, once the spinach has softened, then the peas and tofu. Salt and pepper to taste.

She grew up  a meat eater, nothing crazy but would eat steak, chicken , hot dogs, hamburgers, etc. (Not a huge eater mind you). Before I met her, she had loss the taste for meat and became vegetarian for a good while. This was probably 12 yrs ago or so. Since then she picked up meat again. She said she was at a steakhouse with some friends (on her cycle, for note) and became ravenously back on meat train.

But in the most recent years with a few  minor health issues that have been addressed  and  are helped by an overall better diet and weight loss, she has loss the taste for meat. It seems that it now disgusts her, the smell and thought. She can't even get to point of tasting it. This goes for foods like shrimp and eggs and  all meats between. It seemed kinda all of a sudden. 

I'm thinking its psychological of sort. Her goal was to drop lots of lbs for the health reasons per the doctors and I feel like meat disgust has really pushed toward that goal. Down 48 lbs within probably 4 months. Her diet now is mostly fruits, vrggies, pretzels, potatoes , and starches, and some sandwiches like grill cheese.

Locro de Quinoa--my favorite soup!,79,y7b46d,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y7b46d/locro_de_quinoamy_favorite_soup/,11,1666109173.0,"Forgive me if someone has posted this before. This is one of my favorite recipes! It's very tasty, makes a ton, keeps well and is flexible for friends and family with food needs. It's naturally gluten free, and with a few small changes can be vegetarian or vegan. (Skip to the end for my notes)

So here's the link for the recipe: https://www.laylita.com/recipes/quinoa-and-cheese-soup/

Laylita is a great website if you want to find more Ecuadorian food! 

Ingredients: 
2 tablespoons of oil
1/2 white onion diced, about 1 cup
4 garlic cloves crushed
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon achiote powder
1 teaspoon dry oregano
5-6 potatoes peeled and cut in small chunks, about 2 lbs of potatoes
1 cup uncooked quinoa pre-washed (1 cup = 6 ounces = 170 grams)
8 cups water or broth
1 cup milk add more if the soup is too thick
2 cups grated or crumbled queso fresco can also use mozzarella or feta cheese
4 tablespoons of finely chopped cilantro or parsley to garnish
Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions
Heat the oil over medium heat in a large saucepan or soup pot.
Add the onions, garlic, cumin, achiote, oregano, salt and pepper. Mix well and cook until the onions are soft, about 5-8 minutes.
Add the chopped potatoes; mix them in until coated with onions and spices. Continue to cook them for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the water or broth, bring to a boil.
Add the uncooked quinoa, reduce the temperature and cook on low-medium heat until the quinoa and potatoes are tender, about 25-30 minutes. Stir occasionally. For a creamier and thicker consistency you can use a a masher or wooden spoon to crush/mash some of the potatoes.
Add the milk and cheese, stir and cook for another 5 minutes. If the soup consistency is too thick you can add additional milk to get it to your preferred texture.
Remove from the heat. Add the chopped cilantro or parsley, taste and add additional salt/pepper if needed.
Serve the quinoa and cheese soup with diced or sliced avocado and hot sauce to taste.

Some notes: 
The achoite is what makes it for me. It's a very unique flavor and it's pretty much only used in the Andes (from what I've seen). It can be hard to find in the States, and I normally have to go to a Latin market for it. But it's well worth the trip! 

To make it vegetarian, just make it with vegetable broth! 

To make it vegan, I just leave out the milk and cheese. It's the last step, so it's easy to set aside a portion of it if you just have one person who's vegan. But, it's really good still without the milk and cheese. It has tons of flavor! (My FIL isn't vegan, but he has some digestive problems, especially late at night. So I make it for him with cheese and without depending on the time of day. He says he prefers it without the milk and cheese!) 

Anyway, I know quinoa can be expensive,but it goes a long way! I normally buy a bag for $8, but I can make at least 4 batches of this soup with it. And it's about 8 (big) servings (at least) per batch. This soup is really filling and I've found that even people who ""don't like quinoa"" love this soup! (Oh, there is a version of this soup without the quinoa, it's just called Locro de Papas). Total, this recipe normally costs about $12~ to make. It's very tasty and I have yet to find someone who doesn't love it! (Even among my very picky friends! Lol). 

Anyway, hope you enjoy!",2022-10-18 19:06:13

I braised the meat in a clay pot with parsnips, white wine and herbs, and turned the carcass into stock, but I was still left with the giblets (the heart, kidneys and liver). 

I wasn't too excited about them because I really struggle with the taste of organ meats, but I didn't want to throw them out, so I soaked them in milk overnight and decided to bite the bullet and just go for it. 

I cut the organs into bite-sized pieces, lightly coated them with flower, and fried them up in clarified butter with sliced garlic and a whole lotta onions, then seasoned them generously with salt and pepper and served them with some lingonberry jam I had on hand. 

And they were actually really good? The liver especially. It was tender, soft, and while still had some of that livery taste in it, but the fruity bitterness of the lingonberries turned that from a negative into a positive. There's just something about that combination that works really, really well, like how strawberries and cream bring out the best in each other. 

Anyway, if you're looking for an alternative source of protein in these trying times, maybe give liver a(nother) chance and simply pair it with some lingonberry or cranberry sauce. I have been successfully converted.",2022-10-14 21:24:26

Fresh veggies and fruit for community fridge?,11,y057nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/y057nj/fresh_veggies_and_fruit_for_community_fridge/,16,1665375426.0,"Hi all,

I have recently had the opportunity to purchase groceries for our community fridge, and I'd love some input. Specifically, I'm wondering what fruits and veggies you would be most happy to find at a food pantry or community fridge.

(For those who don't know, a community fridge is a mutual aid project where anyone can give or take food whenever they need/want. It is not a traditional food pantry run by a centralized organization, but a ""give what you can, take what you need"" system. It's usually outdoors and accessible 24 hours a day. A local business agrees to host the fridge on their property and pay the electric bill, and the food is given and taken by anyone in the community.)

Our community fridges do also accept monetary donations (administered through a local partner organization), so a bunch of us are able to purchase groceries to stock the fridges (and the attached freezers and pantries) using those donated funds. 

I always try to make sure I'm getting a good amount of fresh produce, plus some frozen or sometimes canned veggies. I try to get some things that are on sale that week, not only to maximize our donated funds, but also because items on sale are also often what's in season.

Common things I get are apples, clementines, pears, grapes, baby carrots or regular carrots, cucumbers, zucchini, broccoli, green beans, corn, etc. (Plus frozen veggies like peas, corn, various kinds of mixed veggies, etc.) Depends on the season, what looks good, and what has a good price that week. Some weeks I've been able to get great prices on asparagus, salad mix, sliced watermelon, strawberries, raspberries, etc. We often get donations of greens like collards and kale from the community garden.

But I'd also like to know what fruits and veggies some of you would ideally like to find in a community fridge. I know what I would personally like, and what I would have liked when I was really struggling, and I always ask folks who come by the fridge what they would like to see. (Common answers are meat, butter, milk, cheese, whole grain items, dried beans, rice, juice, etc. Plus some vegetarian and dairy free stuff. We usually have a lot of those things covered, plus lots of other shelf staples. But I'm specifically wondering about what PRODUCE might be most appreciated.)

Now that we're approaching winter, the options will start to get slimmer, so I'm trying to think through some good ideas. Like some people would probably love some winter squashes, but some wouldn't want them or be able to make use of them.

I obviously should start asking people specifically about produce when I talk to them at the fridge, and of course answers will vary a lot across communities and individuals, but I'm hoping this group has some good suggestions.



TL;DR:  If you were patronizing a community fridge, what types of produce would you most like to see?",2022-10-10 07:17:06

Over the past months I have been trying to improve my cooking and this has mostly focused on trying out many sauce recipes I have never made previously. At the moment I am trying to find a great cream sauce recipe for pasta (and meatballs) that I can incorporate into my list of 'main recipes' I make on the regular.

However I'm not sure what is going wrong, but so far all the cream sauces I have tried to make have ended up tasting very boring almost like nothing at all. The sauces get way overpowered by the taste of the actual pasta and the meatballs. 

The cream sauces I have tried so far are (recipes linked): [hollandaise sauce](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-hollandaise-sauce/), [swedish meatball gravy](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/218894/easy-swedish-meatball-sauce/), [lemon cream sauce](https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-fish-with-lemon-cream-sauce/), [alfredo sauce americansed](https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/perfect-fettuccine-alfredo), and [white bean chilli sauce](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/creamy-white-chicken-chili/).

For some reason they all taste boring and unpleasant when I try making them for pasta and meatballs.

I am willing to try these specific types of sauces again (e.g. hollandaise, alfredo, etc.) if you have a good trusted recipe for it. But please recommend any good cream sauce as well. Thanks.",2022-10-08 19:09:46

1 large sweet potato

3 carrots
1 can of haricot beans
1 can of red kidney beans
200g of green lentils
5 cloves of garlic
Tea spoon of ginger paste
2 stock cubes

Chop the vegetables and add to a large pot with the beans and lentils. Cover with boiling water and add the stock cubes, garlic and ginger. Cook until vegetables are mostly soft, add the peas and seasoning. Finally, stir in the spinach.

The beans and lentils will thicken the stew nicely and make it more hearty. The vegetables I chose are quite sweet and the soy sauce cuts through it.

Serve with crusty bread, or on its own.

It's brassica season!,96,xyq0z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xyq0z0/its_brassica_season/,22,1665227204.0,"Cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, savoy, kale.

For most of the northern hemisphere, we're heading fast into autumn, and that means it's brassica season.  I love me some brassicas. They're generally cheap and filling, though I realize not everyone likes the flavour.

Starting off with Swedish pizza salad:

* 600 g / 1.3 lbs of white cabbage
* 45 ml / 3 tablespoons of 12% white vinegar (if you're in the US, your white vinegar might be 3-5%, check the bottle)
* 45 ml / 3 tablespoons of water
* 45 ml / 3 tablespoons of rapeseed oil
* 5 ml / 1 teaspoon of (Kosher) salt
* 15 ml / 1 tablespoon of dried oregano
* 2.5 ml / 0.5 teaspoons of (coarsely) ground black pepper
* 2.5 ml / 0.5 teaspoons of Italian salad spice mix
* OPTIONAL: 5 ml / 1 teaspoon of sugar
* OPTIONAL: 1 dl / \~0.5 cup of drained pickled bell pepper, roughly chopped

Shred the cabbage finely. Mix the other ingredients in a pot and heat until steaming hot, but not boiling. Pour over cabbage. Grab a spoon (or wear a glove) and beat/massage the cabbage until soft. Cool at room temperature, cover and chill thoroughly. Serve cold.

Usually tastes the best the next day, but will keep for 5-7 days in a cold fridge.

Trick was definitely not more oil or butter but optimal moisture.

Absorb water from uncooked hashbrowns with a paper towel

(left it wrapped in a papertowel in the refrigerator overnight)

Morning:

2-3 tablespoons of olive oil in a regular 10 inch stainless steel pan.

Sprinkle hashbrowns in when the oil starts to lightly smoke

spread them and pat them gently with a stainless steel spatula till evenly spread.

(dont flip till you see golden browning on the other side)

Scrape and Flip once! Pad down till the other side is golden brown and crisp to your liking.

DONE in under 15 minutes with perfect texture and taste.

* 1 & 1/2 cups of brown rice ($1.20)
* 1/2 cup red Quinoa ($1.20)

* 16 oz white button mushrooms ($6.15)
* 16 oz Grape Tomatoes ($3.00)
* 2 cups diced red cabbage ($0.60)
* 2 cups small diced carrots ($1.00)
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 1 tsp soy sauce (applied at eating)
* Black pepper
* Red chili pepper powder (highly optional, I make homemade and love spicy)

**Total Cost: $16.24, $3.25 per meal.**

**Directions:**

* Bring water to a boil

Pro Tip: if you prep your veggies first and get the water heated, you can cook both the grains and veggies at the same time for the same amount of time!

**Variations:**

* Swap out any of the veggies for seasonal or preferred options
   * Every few weeks or so I'll swap the tomatoes for bell peppers
   * Swap out sweet potato for the carrots
   * Swap brussels's for asparagus
   * Get creative! 90% of veggies will cook fine in the 20 minute 400 degree range
* Got some hummus laying around? Mix in a spoonful or two!
* Need more bulk? Split a can of black beans into the containers after everything is cooked.
* Not vegan? Want more protein?
   * Place a 4-6oz salmon filet on top. Delicious!
   * Place a fried egg or two on top
      * Power move: fry the whole concoction in oil then mix in two eggs. makes a super tasty breakfast egg bowl.
   * Add sliced grilled chicken breast",2022-10-06 18:28:19

A few thoughts so far:  
  
Bananas. Cheap and can eat them raw without prep work and without needing salt, sugar, etc.  
  
Popcorn. Supposedly good for fiber. I won't eat without a bunch of butter and salt though.  
  
Can of Black Beans. Rinse these and drain. Good for various things health wise. I could add to burritos which I am accustomed to eating.  
  
Not a fan of oatmeal. Tastes ok after pouring in a ton of brown sugar and butter, but on a hot weather season it doesn't sound good. And it takes too long. I've tried overnight oats, cold, it was terrible, unless I simply didn't do it right.  
  
My current meals only take 11-12 minutes to make (smashed burgers). With deli bought pre-made Amish Macaroni Salad and Baked Beans. And I eat this meal twice daily.  
  
My snack is usually tortilla chips and a cheese dip. Or, a bag of Cajun Trail Mix. And some ice cream at night.

I didn't have rich and complete meals, just something to go through the day without having too many repercussions. Sometimes I've eaten only a banana or a small portion of a salad in an entire day.

I'm going to see some specialists to deal with this but for now, I would like to try to recover at least a little bit by myself.

I think I need some meals with the following characteristics:

* easy to make, so that even when I have no appetite I can do them without putting too much effort
* affordable (anything from the Mediterranean diet is pretty cheap here, but if that's too limiting, feel free to add foods from other geographic areas)
* bonus points if they are high in calories without making me feel like I'm eating too much

Here is what I have available

* microwave: both at home and school, so if you have some ideas for what I can bring to eat when I'm out that will also be greatly appreciated
* stove
* mixer

Preferences and restrictions (feel free to ignore this part if it's too restricting, I know I have a problem with that)

* I'm celiac, which means I can't eat stuff like orzo or farro, but I have ""free"" access to things like pasta, bread, oat, corn flakes, biscuits, granola bars, crackers (basically gluten-free options of foods that contain gluten)
* I prefer vegan milk over dairy milk, usually soy, coconut, almond, or rice milk
* I only have evo oil and I can't buy other kinds due to the high prices
* I prefer vegan options
* I eat chicken or turkey a few times a month, I don't eat pork and I eat beef very few times a year
* seafood of choice is generally tuna or salmon, sardines are also fine
* I don't like to eat a lot of dairies, also because I tend to have an iron deficit, but they are fine too, maybe once or twice a week

Any advice, even if not strictly related to what I asked, is greatly appreciated.

Rice: sautéed 1 tablespoon of butter and mixed 1 cup of jasmine rice in it for about a minute, then added 2 cups of chicken stock. Bring to a boil then let it simmer

Pickled veggies: thinly sliced cucumber and red onion in a mason jar with 1 cup rice vinegar, 3/4 cup of white sugar, some chilli flakes. Shake it up then let it sit for at least an hour

And not just for breakfast!",306,xtz2v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xtz2v4/i_love_porridge_cheap_healthy_versatile/,35,1664742864.0,"I adore porridge of all kinds; both sweet and savory. My current favorite grains to use are **oats, brown rice, rye berries** and **millet** but you can also use **barley, white or basmati rice, quinoa** or **amaranth** (a bit more expensive), **wheat** (whole, cracked or bulgur), **buckwheat** or **corn** (hominy).

**Sweet porridge**

is probably the most well-known, like prepackaged oatmeal and cream of wheat.  But it’s much more cost-effective to make your own!  I like to keep **dried and frozen fruits** in larger quantities, but it’s also possible to find things like **raisins, cranberries, prunes** and even sometimes **dates** in **small, cheap packets** at grocery stores or dollar stores.  Sweeteners can be plain old **sugar** or **molasses**, or you can get more creative and use **fruit juice** or **fruit juice concentrates** for added flavor (I like the cheapo frozen ones in a can that are around $1 each).  **Mashed up bananas** and **apples** also add good flavor and sweetness.

I mostly make my sweet porridges with just water and fruit, but other delicious additions (that will keep you satisfied longer) are **milk, cream, coconut milk, nut milks, coconut oil, butter** or **ghee**.  **Nuts, seeds** and **nut butters** also great additions if you have them.  **Protein powder**–or anything you might normally add to a smoothie–work well too for added flavor and protein.  I sometimes like to blend in a **whole egg** for added protein myself.

**Savory porridge**

is something you don’t hear much about but can also be immensely satisfying and delicious.  **Soup stocks, meats, fats** and **veggies** added to porridge grains can be incredibly satisfying and comforting, not to mention healthy.  I absolutely LOVE **oats paired with beef** (whole, steel cut or Irish oats are my favorites here), especially when there are also mushrooms, onions and/or garlic involved.  **Rice porridge with chicken and dark leafy greens** is also one I like to make a lot.

Savory porridges can be flavored with **chicken or beef stock, mushroom powder** (or **cooked mushrooms**), **bouillon cubes, ramen soup packets, seasoning mixes** (like Adobo, Sazon, etc), dried **seaweeds** or just plain **salt**.  Sauteed or **carmelized onions** or **garlic** also add magic.  **Sauces** and individual **flavoring packets** from fast food places or ready made meals can also work well here.  Throw in bits of **meat** like **ground beef or turkey, shredded chicken, ham cubes**.  Add cooked or canned **beans** if you like.  You could also just add some seasoning and an **egg** and have a simple savory porridge.  The possibilities are endless!

Edit: savory porridge is also a great way to use some of the scraps I mentioned [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xtusev/save_your_scraps_so_many_delicious_healthy_things/).   
 Pureed broccoli and cauliflower ends or kale stems, homemade bone broth, chicken or beef fat; all can have a home in a delicious savory porridge!

**To make porridge**

simply **cook your grains until they are soft and mushy**.  With quick oats, cracked wheat or hominy this is simple and fairly quick, but with whole grains it takes a bit more time. You need to either set them to simmer for many hours (on the stove or in a slow cooker) or cook them like rice and then add some water and blend them up to break them apart for porridge.

I like to cook my grains in **larger batches and then freeze** in small containers for making quick porridge when I want it (my freezer is full of little containers of already-cooked brown rice, millet, whole oats and whole rye).  When I want some for breakfast or to thicken my soup I simply thaw out in the microwave, add to a pot with some extra liquid, puree with my stick blender and cook on low for a few minutes with whatever I add-ins and seasonings I feel like using that meal.

The process from freezer to steaming hot meal **only takes about 10 minutes or so**.  I have also pre-made porridge and frozen it to thaw in the microwave for an even quicker meal.

**Sweet porridge ideas:**

* Strawberries and cream – frozen strawberries and milk or cream, sweeten to taste
* Apple spice raisin – apple juice concentrate, raisins and apple spice mix (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice)
* Coconut chai spice – warm spices and coconut milk (and/or coconut oil)
* Millet with blueberries – mix frozen blueberries while it’s cooking to turn it purple!
* Coconut turmeric – coconut flakes and/or coconut milk and/or coconut oil and turmeric, sugar
* Brown sugar (or molasses), cinnamon, raisins
* Banana walnut – mashed bananas, walnuts, nutmeg
* Ginger pear – chopped pear, chopped fresh ginger, apple juice concentrate (or sugar)
* Blueberry lemon – frozen blueberries and lemonade concentrate
* Sugarplum – chopped prunes, apple or grape juice concentrate
* Summer fruit – peaches, apricots, plums and/or berries
* Eggnog - egg yolks, milk or cream, nutmeg (good with rice or oats)

**Savory porridge ideas:**

* Oat porridge with beef, broccoli and bouillon powder (whole, steel or Scottish oats work best here!)
* Rye and oat porridge with chicken broth and shredded chicken
* Millet porridge with ground turkey and Adobo seasoning
* Mixed grains porridge with sauteed leafy greens (kale, chard, dandelion), onions and beef chunks
* Oat and rice porridge with sauteed mushrooms, garlic, onion and spinach
* Millet or corn porridge with pork/bacon fat, collards and ham or bacon pieces
* Rice porridge with shredded chicken, coconut milk, sauteed onions and mushroms
* Millet, corn or oat porridge with italian sausage and spinach

**Grains:**

I buy my grains in their whole form in 50 pound bags because I can do a lot more with them.  They can be cooked and eaten whole, ground into flour to make breads and baked goods (rye sourdough pancakes, mmm), pureed and used to thicken soups or added whole to salads for extra fiber/texture/nutrition (whole rye berries with garden tomatoes, diced cucumbers and fresh herbs is one of my favorite summer side dishes!  And whole cooked oats with ground beef and spinach makes an amazingly satisfying dinner).

Bodegas and Asian markets will generally have good prices for rice, millet, buckwheat and corn.  Bakery supplies will often carry whole wheat, oats and rye.  I get ours from a local bakery supply, but have found decent prices online as well.  I’ve heard they can also sometimes be purchased directly from farms but you have to be sure they are grown for human consumption because those sold for animal feed are often fumigated and contaminated by rodents.taminated by rodents.

Can you defrost and marinate meat at the same time?,15,xty78u,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xty78u/can_you_defrost_and_marinate_meat_at_the_same_time/,18,1664740726.0,"I’m going away for a couple of days and will be home in time to cook dinner, if I get it half ready in advance.

"Save your scraps! SO MANY delicious, healthy things can be made--or simply enhanced--using leftover meat and veggie bits.",56,xtusev,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xtusev/save_your_scraps_so_many_delicious_healthy_things/,16,1664732432.0,"We save all our **chicken** and **turkey bones** and cutoff pieces (backs, necks, etc) and freeze them until we have enough to make a big pot (beef bones and cutoffs too!).  When you have enough, simply add to a pot on the stove and simmer for 4-8 hours (6-10 hours for beef) or overnight in a crockpot.  Strain into a pot and chill until fat congeals on top and can be scraped off.  Save fat for sautees and stirfries and freeze the broth in small containers (and/or ice cube trays) for use in soups and sauces (or for drinking from a mug on a cold day–mmm!).

**Beef scraps** from steak trimmings can also be used.  When I have enough I like to brown them in the oven to boost the umami flavor before simmering (if you’re just simmering the meat/fat without the bones you won’t need to simmer as long).  Pour off and save any fat for cooking with later and simmer the meat like you would chicken stock.

**Chicken skin** can also be saved to make schmaltz for cooking (simmer on low or in a crockpot for a few hours until rendered) or to fry up into crispy chicken chips.  **Pork fat** can be rendered the same way and adds a really nice flavor to stirfries.

We also save **veggie scraps** for making soup stock.  Good ones are **onion skins** and ends, **garlic skins** and ends, **scallion** ends, **carrot peelings**, **zucchini ends**, **bell pepper ends** and piths, **celery leaves and ends** and **fresh herb stems**.  Also good are **asparagus stems**, **Brussels sprouts ends** and **chard** and **kale stems**.  All of these add good flavor and depth to meat stocks, or can be simmered alone for simple veggie stock.

Veggie scraps from cruciferous vegetables like **broccoli stems** and leaves and **cauliflower butts**, and the tough stems from green leafy veggies like **chard, kale, cabbage and dandelion** are also good ones to save.  They may be too tough or ugly to eat on their own, but **cooked until tender and then pureed** they add excellent flavor, fiber and nutrition to soups and sauces (pro tip: chop stems into small pieces before freezing.  They cook faster and don’t leave long fibers after pureeing).

Simply simmer your veg of choice in a little water or broth until tender.  Puree with a stick blender or in a stand-up mixer and thin to desired consistency/flavor (**with water, soup stock, milk, cream,** or **nondairy milk** or **cream**) and add seasoning of your choice (**bouillon cubes, ramen soup packets, nutritional yeast,** premade seasonings like **Adobo or Sazon,** fresh or dried **herbs, sauteed onions, garlic powder,** or just plain **salt**).

To make a **thicker, heartier soup** I will often also puree in something **starchy** like **rice** (leftover rice and the stuff that sticks to the bottom of the pot is great to eliminate waste), **potatoes, oats** (surprisingly delicious in savory dishes!) **beans, peas** or **lentils**.  For **added protein** add a raw **egg** and cook with the soup, or blend in **meat** of your choice (adds flavor, protein and thicker consistency).  The possibilities are nearly endless and the results are thick, creamy, hearty soups that are so comforting on cold days.

**Some ideas:**

* Cauliflower butts with milk or cream (or coconut milk/cream) and carmelized onions and garlic
* Celery stems and leaves with water, a bouillon cube (or ramen soup packet!) and nutritional yeast
* Rainbow chard stems with cooked rice (or leftover congee), chicken stock and some chopped chicken breast
* Kale stems with oats, beef and a ramen soup packet
* Broccoli butts with chicken stock, an egg and salt

Just these few things make SO MANY different dishes.  It eliminates a lot of waste and makes your fresh produce go a lot farther.  Since I started using my veggie scraps I have far less waste than I ever did and wound up with a lot of new dishes that I love and look forward to making on cold days.

The Simple Power of a Sunday Roast,238,xtu3oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xtu3oq/the_simple_power_of_a_sunday_roast/,13,1664730714.0,"Every autumn I rediscover The Sunday Roast and you really can't beat it.  Although a roast can take hours and be many-step process,  it doesn't have to be if you don't want it to be. It can actually be simpler, cheaper, and more satisfying than many other dishes.

I get big chicken legs and put sliced garlic in & under the skin.   I roast it in the oven with a quartered onion,  another clove of garlic, cubed potatoes, carrots (optional butter and honey).  Oil, salt, and roast at 200 degrees C for 30-45 minutes or until chicken is cooked-through. I serve with peas. 

If you want an easy low-effort gravy blend a few of the roasted carrot batons + the onion + garlic clove + chicken juices + some thyme.  

Of course, to make it healthier you could boil the potatoes and carrots instead. Just a reminder because I moved to a new country and I've been struggling to work out how to eat cheaply here.",2022-10-02 20:11:54

 **Type:** Salad

**Cuisine:** Bulgarian

**Keywords:** Bulgarian shopska salad step by step, Bulgarian cuisine, Bulgarian salads, Bulgarian recipes, Bulgarian shopska salad recipe

**Recipe Yield:** 4

**Preparation Time:** 20 minutes

**Total Time:** 20 minutes  


**Recipe Ingredients:**

* 2 large tomatoes
* half green bell pepper
* half a large Dutch cucumber
* 1 head of red onion
* 100 grams of fresh Bulgarian white cheese (can be feta)
* Salt
* extra virgin olive oil or normal oil
* vinegar (optional)
* black olives
* parsley

**Recipe Instructions:** We wash all the vegetables well and as you can see in the photos on the next page we cut them all. First dice the tomatoes and put them in a bowl. Cut the cucumber into slices cut in half and add it to the tomatoes. Cut the pepper into small strips and add it to the bowl. Cut the onion into small strips as in the photo and add it to the rest of the cut vegetables. Cut the parsley, add to the bowl, salt, pour olive oil and mix.

Grate the white cheese directly into the bowl that already contains the vegetables. Add the olives and serve like this. We can mix directly before putting in smaller dishes. We can serve as a salad with the second course. In the recipe I did not mention the amount of oil, salt, vinegar or olives to add, because we add these products to our liking. 

As a curiosity I would like to add that in Bulgaria, many times this and many salads are served before the main course or dinner with a glass of rakia. Maybe explain to the uninitiated that rakia is Bulgarian homemade alcohol similar to hard liquor (very good), which is made from fruits such as grapes or plums.

Buy a decent ham and the accessories for sandwiches - bread or rolls, a couple of kinds of sliced cheese, condiments, etc. Make a big salad. Set everything on the table and done.

Second version - a diy pizza bar. Get all the fixings, with individual crusts, a few jars of sauce, cheese, etc. Set everything on the counter and turn on the oven. This could backfire, so to make sure YOU aren't making all those pizzas, make it a competition with small prizes for prettiest pizza, most innovative,  most unusual, etc. This could evome a tradition and prevent an argument over who cooks next year.

Comment,4,j0sit4r,,0,1671415698.0,"I’m a chef, so I thought I’d share my knowledge too.

Soup is a really good large meal that can be made without being in the kitchen the whole time/all day. I suggest a chicken corn chowder or I can share a personal recipe of mine for something similar to chicken noodle but sweeter if you wanted it. You can use canned chicken for this. Don’t throw out the water it comes in, add it to the soup. On another note, I find broccoli cheese has a higher chance of having someone who doesn’t like it so I don’t suggest that. You could have bread rolls with the soups that are from frozen packs. 

Shepherds pie is also easy, cheap, and can make a lot and is quick. If you add teriyaki sauce to the ground beef before putting it in the oven, you’ll get a very nice savory flavor too. It reheats well too. If you do any of the ones above, I suggest having some kind of simple side like a salad.

Lastly, breakfast for dinner is always a hit. Costco has pre-cooked 42 packs of bacon for $11 that you can just heat up real quick and if you add bananas or chocolate chips to pancakes it’ll be a big hit. For the scrambled eggs, I suggest adding about 2 tablespoons of milk or just enough so that the mixture looks a little lighter, before cooking. It’ll make the eggs fluffier and a little less strong. You can do everything in advance and just keep it warm in the oven until it’s time.",2022-12-19 04:08:18
Comment,1,j0siq1h,,0,1671415658.0,"For low effort, baking and crock pot cooking is the way to go. Let the oven/crockpot do the work for hours and hours. 

Roasted brussel sprouts. 1. Prep: wash and cut in half, put in aluminum lined pan and toss with olive oil, kosher salt, and ground black peppercorns. Wrap the aluminum closed to make a packet. 2. Time to bake: 350-450F (if you are cooking other things, it’s flexible). Cook for 15-25 min depending on temp, and open and toss for the last 5 minutes to get a nice roasted side. You can flip twice if you want even roasting on both sides but that takes more time.

Fresh bread can be prepped (knead and let rise) ahead of time but is somewhat time consuming and messy if you’re not adept at it. It’s also very simple and cheap as it’s just starter/yeast, water and flour. If you can get sourdough starter from someone it’s a great asset to keep in the fridge and make your own bread with just flour and water whenever you like super cheap, and people LOVE it. 

Yams/sweet potato: I wouldn’t eliminate these. But idk how you make them so here’s my super simple “recipe”: I just wash and wrap them in aluminum whole and while still wet (the little water helps cook and keep moist). Bake around 350F for 20-30 minutes depending on size. So freaking sweet and delicious as is, I don’t even add butter. I don’t actually know the dif between yams and sweet potato, I use the more reddish ones not the ones that are more yellow inside. 

Carnitas: super easy, low effort, cheap cut of meat, high deliciousness. Take a pork shoulder or butt and put it in the crock pot for 10-12 hours on low. Just add black pepper and a head or two of peeled garlic cloves and a chopped white or yellow onion or two. Usually it’s salty enough for me as is, but ppl can salt to taste. Just needs to be shredded with a fork and served. If you want to put in extra effort and time, you can separately caramelize a bunch of onions and bell pepper in a large frying or saucepan to serve “Philly cheesesteak” style with the carnitas. 

Squashes: butternut, acorn, spaghetti, &c. These can all be baked to deliciousness. Minimal seasoning required. Acorn squash is amazing with a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. 

Someone said lasagna, a champion of feeding a crowd. Meatloaf is a great option esp. to use up leftover ingredients from other recipes. Just add sausage/beef, egg, and breadcrumbs. Top with a brown sugar/tomato paste glaze. Soup stock is another way to use up leftover odds and ends. When I’m making larger meals I might jus toss all my vegetable scraps into a stock pot and add a boned chicken carcass (pick up a couple roasted hens at $5 a pop from Costco or Smart & Final, just strip them of the meat with your fingers, and use the carcasses). The $5 roasted chickens are a huge time and money saver; if you just got 3-5 of these you could make them the main feature. 

Casseroles are simple as well, from a mac-n-cheese style to vegetable forward options. Just add your choice of sauce/cheeses to a base of small shape pasta (shells, macaroni, rigatoni, &c.) and add meat and veg as you see fit. 

Also make a large salad or two: chop and mix the lettuce/spring mix/spinach or whatever , then set all other ingredients on the top. I usually go with 3-5 veggies and a fruit or two, and a cheese. Leave the dressing off and toss at the table at mealtime (or assign the task to a teen or adult). Examples:

Salad one: fill bowl with fresh spinach. On top put sliced mushrooms, dried cranberries, julienned red onion & red bell pepper, diced bacon, Brie. When serving, toss in a balsamic or blush wine vinaigrette.

Salad two: 1/3 Romaine, 1/3 red or green leaf, 1/3 spring mix. (Julienned)yellow bell pepper, red onion, tomato, grated carrot, cheese of choice (maybe Gorgonzola or goat?), dressing of choice (maybe lemon poppyseed or ranch?) 

Zucchini and banana make great simple dessert breads. I like a bit of orange peel and/or ginger root in my banana bread. Pumpkin pies are incredibly cheap, I usually just buy one, but making your own gives an opportunity to reduce sugar content. 

Hope that helps, happy holidays and good luck!",2022-12-19 04:07:38

Boneless. Skinless chicken is high in protein.

Mori Nu silken tofu is great to add to smoothies. We use it to make high protein pudding. We blend milk, silken tofu, protein powder and pudding mix. It's makes a super tasty snack or desert. Chocolate with a banana added or peanut butter is a great combo.

Comment,2,j0sgiev,,0,1671414612.0,"I've been into quick-cooking grits or polenta lately- I found this fancy bag of Bob's Red Mill polenta in the back of my cupboard, and it's a great quick meal because I can have a single serving on the table in under ten minutes, plus a few more minutes if I feel like frying an egg to go with it.

This [egg drop soup](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/egg-drop-soup/) is very comforting, and it's easy enough for me to throw together even when I'm tired and sick. If you omit the green onions like I do, every ingredient is either nonperishable (seasonings, bouillon powder if that's what you use), freezable (ginger root, garlic cloves), or just lasts a very long time (eggs, Better Than Bouillon if that's what you use). It's easy to bulk out with a little leftover rice or noodles, a handful of frozen wontons (tossed straight into the cold broth as it's heating up), or even leftover meat or vegetables.

Outside of that, most of my meals are either [batch-cooked and frozen for workdays](https://old.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xmhl30/meal_prep_a_guide/), or they're ""cheat"" meals like instant ramen, Easy Mac, boxed pasta dinners, or random freezer snacks heated in the air fryer.

Comment,1,j0sfchi,,0,1671414057.0,"Charcuterie can be fun. I've lined my table with brown Kraft paper and made a full on grazing table. No formal dinner, just everyone coming and going as they want. It's definitely a bit of work to arrange but easy enough for anyone to help top off as things need replenishing. And everything can be prepped/chopped ahead.

Easy pasta dishes are great. Roasted red pepper pasta is my favorite. Make the sauce ahead and add to noodles day of. Fancy garlich bread or focaccia are great additions. 

Also chicken cordon bleu can be a great comparable dish with similar trimmings but saves you the heavy labour and mess of a turkey. 

Another idea I've played around with is BBQ steak. If you plan your veggies on the full too it's very Minal cleanup! But that might be weather dependent since I don't know where you live. I'm in Canada and up here we would totally brave the cold for a good steak 😆

Comment,1,j0savgw,,0,1671411922.0,"We usually do a big, all-the-fixings dinner on Christmas Day, and a lighter and less formal Christmas Eve dinner (chicken and rice, grilled sandwiches, etc.). This year, we're doing a modified ""big dinner"" on Christmas Eve (ham, mashed potatoes, green beans, homemade rolls, cranberry sauce, maybe some raw veggies like carrots and celery -- but not dressing, yams, fruit salad, blah blah blah), and Christmas Day will be leftovers: ham on rolls, Christmas cookies, more raw veggies. It sounded easier and we all love ham or turkey on rolls in the days after the holidays, so why not make it a feature this year?

Lasagna, baked pasta, and enchiladas all sound like great options that you can prep in advance and just toss in the oven the day of. Here are a few other ideas that could work:

* Chicken pot pie or shepherds pie, which are an entire meal in a pie dish 

* Crockpot pork loin or roast beef, shredded for barbecue sandwiches with fancy bakery rolls or with green chilies for burritos, enchiladas, or nachos 

* Oven baked ribs (https://www.inspiredtaste.net/7179/sweet-and-spicy-oven-baked-ribs/ has great, easy technique; we often get boneless ribs from Costco instead)

I also like to shred some Warrigal Greens & Nasturtium leaves from the garden while I'm waiting on the noodles to cook, but it's altogether unnecessary.

Once the noodles are done to satisfaction(they cook in like 3 minutes), I just pour the lot right on top of my egg in the bowl, bung in my garden-greens, stir the egg in, and finish with apple mint & a sting of Sriracha.

The same can be done with fresh veg', which I do prefer, though those require finer slicing, and OP said ""Pantry/Freezer"".

Then we have one roast leg of lamb, a bunch of roast veggies(parsnip, sweet potato, potato, carrot, pumpkin), maybe some peas and some gravy, maybe some potato salad or whatever other salad the other families in our Christmas bring, but often they just bring a dessert or nothing (we usually have 6 adults and approximately 7 adult kids)

It's basically just lentil and rice porridge, you can make it as thick or thin as you like, and flavor it however you want, there are infinite combinations of foods and flavors that you can do with this as your protein/carb base.

This is how I do mine:

Heat a dry sauce pan on medium heat, and toss in 1/2 tsp whole cumin, and 1/2 tsp mustard seed. toast these things until the mustard seeds are popping, and are well underway, make sure you don't burn your cumin. To this, add a tbsp of ghee or butter, then 1/2 cup lentils, and 1 cup water or veggie (chicken?) stock. Add salt to taste. Wait 10 minutes, then add 1/2 cup of rice and another cup of water/stock. Boil this on medium(ish) heat stirring regularly, if it gets too thick, add some more liquid. It's done when the rice is all the way cooked and the lentils are totally dissolved.

I top it with anything I want, but it's usually avocados, a fried egg, some pumpkin seeds, some nute yeast, sriracha (rip), and some braggs liquid aminos or soy sauce.

Something else you can do with celery, OP, is roast chicken, turkey or beef with it. Like don't stuff the chicken, but leave it empty and bake it whilst sitting on top of a bed of celery. The moisture in the meat flavors and softens it, and that's one of my favorite things to eat when I make a roast. The celery doesnt make it to the table. I'll eat it all while I let the meat rest.

A little goes a long way. 

So for OP, I would say yes have a bacon and egg sandwich once or twice a week but add a leaf of lettuce and slice of tomato. Or whatever veggies they like to it. Skip the margarine and use a very small amount of olive oil or butter instead. Once they get used to veggies in their breakfast sandwich they can do bacon as a less often treat.

Another suggestion is if you eat tuna or sardines, is to get them packed in olive oil, not water.  That makes them taste so much nicer anyway.",2022-12-18 05:14:44

Comment,94,j0o14t4,,0,1671332843.0,"Breakfast: This is where I shine, baby. I've actually mathematically figured out how many calories I need to eat in the morning to keep me full until lunch. I'm decently active and I'm a 5'4"" woman, so it's 500-650.

Smoothies are the lazy go-to. They sell frozen fruit that is just for blending into smoothies. Get the frozen fruit of your choice, blend with a scoop of protein powder and the dairy of your choice, and you're done. For an even easier one that doesn't require a blender, just get a blender bottle and pre-made smoothie fruit blend. Bolthouse makes good ones. I add a cup of the Bolthouse Blue Goodness, a scoop of pea protein powder, and a cup of vanilla soy milk to a blender bottle. Shake violently for about 90 seconds and then consume. Easy peasy (because pea protein, lol).

Bagel with cream cheese. I know it sounds overly simplistic, but one bagel has like 245 calories and you can add 100 calories of cream cheese, pair with a Greek yogurt cup, and boom, you've got a 500-calorie breakfast full of protein. My favorite breakfast. (I prefer the skinny bagels that are only like 110 calories, but I like to put lots of oat creamer in my coffee, so it balances out!)

Egg burrito. My second favorite breakfast. Scramble an egg, throw it on a tortilla with cheese, boom. Done. You can oomph it up by adding some precooked sausage (just heat it up while you're cooking the egg) or just go with the egg and cheese.

Turkey sandwich. Yeah, just a regular turkey sandwich. You can eat non-breakfast foods at breakfast and sometimes it works out great. Or just throw the sandwich ingredients into a tortilla and make a wrap to eat on the go.


Lunch: 

Make enough of last night's dinner, but double or triple the recipe and then that's your lunch. It's super simple. 

If you want a quick lunch to throw together in the morning, a turkey sandwich can't go wrong. A baked potato takes 2-3 minutes to cook and you can add some premade soup or beans to it.


Snacks:

My favorite snack is a plate with a babybel cheese, a handful of mixed nuts, and some carrot sticks and cucumber slices with caesar dressing for dipping. If you buy one of those pre-made veggie trays, it's even easier!

Spoonful of peanut butter can't go wrong. They make snack squeeze ones, too.

Dried fruits are packed with calories and also vitamins.


Dinner:

Tacos can be high calorie or low calorie depending on how you make them. My taco recipe is just a ground protein (I use either chicken or ground lean pork), canola oil, spices and seasonings (garlic salt, cholula, paprika, and crushed red pepper flakes), a small white onion, and some chopped mini peppers. Takes maybe 10 minutes to cook.

Protein pasta. They make pasta with protein in it. Saute an onion in some olive oil, pour in a jar of tomato sauce, make the noodles. Done. Don't have to fuss with a protein. Add a few handfuls of shredded broccoli slaw to make it healthy. Takes 10 minutes to cook.

Frozen salad shrimp. They're so small you don't have to de-vein them, but the only drawback is that they cook (and overcook) really fast because they're tiny. I like to whip up a quick stirfry with a pack of frozen veggies. Because the shrimp are so tiny, you don't have to defrost them. Just throw them in and give them 2 minutes and they're done. They also go great with fried rice. 10-15 minutes to cook.

Instant rice. I love the Ben's Original jasmine or seasoned rice packets. They take 90 seconds to cook and you can open up a can of seasoned black beans and that's it. Or have the rice with your stirfry! Since you don't like rice, instant potatoes are a close second and can be enjoyed in almost the same ways.

Rotisserie chicken. Just straight up buy yourself a rotisserie chicken and hack off pieces and eat them with a baked potato or instant rice and a handful of salad mix or a frozen veggie side. My lunch yesterday was just pieces scraped off of the bones of a rotisserie chicken like a feral dog and handful of salad greens.

Sheet pan dinner! Chop up potatoes and veggies (carrots, radishes, and celery are my picks) and lay them out on a baking sheet. Add 3tbls of butter and a drizzle of olive oil, garlic salt or the seasonings of your choice. Cover with foil and bake at 375F for 20-30 minutes. Add any protein you want or just make a bunch of it as an easy side. Takes about 10 minutes to prep and 20-30 to cook, but you don't have to do anything, just let it bake.",2022-12-18 05:07:23

1) peanut butter 2c ~$3 (chunky if you want, or you can get some roasted peanuts as additional garnish) 

2) chicken (buy a whole chicken) ~$6

3) Sweet Potatoes 2lbs ~$3

4) Red Onion $1

5) Collard Greens 1 bunch $1

6) Garlic ~$1

7) Chicken Broth (~40oz) ~$3 or make it yourself from the chicken carcass

8) Diced tomatoes with juice 28oz ~$2

9) Spices - cumin, chili powder, Red Pepper, cayenne pepper, turmeric, salt, pepper, MSG, apple cider vinegar (~4tbsp), hot sauce, bay leaves, whatever you think would be good. Most of the online recipes are kind of bland, so I added all of the above stuff. The vinegar is important imo to brighten and enhance the flavor. 

Cook chicken (diced) in some oil to brown, remove from pot. 

Cook onion until translucent, add garlic and saute 1 minute. Add diced sweet potatoes, tomatoes with juice, browned chicken, 2 bay leaves, some salt and pepper, red pepper flakes, and the chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then simmer (covered) for 30 minutes.

Add the peanut butter and chopped collard greens, apple cider vinegar cook on low heat for like 10 more minutes.

Nuts and seeds, whatever you like.

PBJ, make it with lots of filling and it can be 500-600 calories. I use peanut only PB, real fruit only jam and whole what bread.

Get premade pizza dough and load it up! 

Add powdered milk to cream soups, smoothies, yogurt oatmeal 

Make a frittata with eggs, milk, cheese, ham, veggies etc. I like to do a Mediterranean version with sun dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, feta. 

If you can afford salmon, tuna (canned or fresh!) they are great sources of protein and healthy fat. Add ginger and brown sugar on the salmon.
